proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The

on penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with

those persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse),
