HEADER_1:
Risks related to our operations
HEADER_2:
Our auditors have expressed doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. If we do not generate substantial revenue from our patent litigation and are also unable
to obtain capital from other resources, we will significantly curtail our operations or halt them entirely.
HEADER_3:
We have experienced relatively large
losses during our development and, without significant increases in the market penetration of our services and improvements to
our operating margins, we will not achieve profitability.
HEADER_4:
It will be difficult for you to evaluate
us based on our past performance because we have a relatively new business strategy with a limited operating history.
HEADER_5:
We cannot guarantee that the patents
issued to us will be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection of our proprietary technologies.
HEADER_6:
We may incur substantial costs as a result
of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.
HEADER_7:
If we lose our key personnel our operations could be harmed.
HEADER_8:
We may not be able to economically comply
with any new government regulation that may be adopted with respect to the Internet.
HEADER_9:
Risks related to our common stock
HEADER_10:
Possible issuances of our
capital stock would cause dilution to our existing shareholders.
HEADER_11:
Certain shareholders control a substantial
portion of our outstanding common stock.
HEADER_12:
No dividends have been paid on our common
stock.
HEADER_13:
We are subject to "penny stock"
regulations which may adversely impact the liquidity and price of our common stock.
HEADER_14:
The exercise or conversion of outstanding
options into common stock will dilute the percentage ownership of our other shareholders. The sale of such common stock or other
common stock in the open market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
