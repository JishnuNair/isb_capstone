Item 1A.  Risk Factors
HEADER_2:
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks or others not specified below materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
HEADER_3:
Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry

If the IT security market does not continue to adopt our virtual machine-based security platform, our sales will not grow as quickly as anticipated, or at all, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
HEADER_5:
If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.
HEADER_6:
Real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services, the misconfiguration of our products, the failure of our products or services to block malware or prevent a security breach, or the failure of customers to take action on attacks identified by our products could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations.
HEADER_7:
Our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.

Recent and future acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.
HEADER_9:
We have had operating losses each year since our inception, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
HEADER_10:
Fluctuating economic conditions make it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.
HEADER_11:
We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
HEADER_12:
We rely on our management team and other key employees and will need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including members for our board of directors, could harm our business.
HEADER_13:
We expect our revenue growth rate to decline.
HEADER_14:
Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.
HEADER_15:
Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.
HEADER_16:
If we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected.
HEADER_17:
If the general level of advanced cyber attacks declines, or is perceived by our current or potential customers to have declined, our business could be harmed.
HEADER_18:
Our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales, billings and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.
HEADER_19:
If we are unable to sell additional products, subscriptions and services, as well as renewals of our subscriptions and services, to our customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
HEADER_20:
Reliance on shipments at the end of each quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.
HEADER_21:
If we do not accurately anticipate and respond promptly to changes in our customers’ technologies, business plans or security needs, our competitive position and prospects could be harmed.
HEADER_22:
Disruptions or other business interruptions that affect the availability of our Dynamic Threat Intelligence, or DTI, cloud or other cloud-based products and services we offer or may offer could adversely impact our customer relationships as well as our overall business.
HEADER_23:
If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners and technology alliance partners, or if our channel partners or technology alliance partners fail to perform, our ability to market, sell and distribute our platform will be limited, and our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed.
HEADER_24:
Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or enhancements to our platform that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.
HEADER_25:
If we are unable to increase sales of our platform to large organizations while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial position and results of operations may suffer.
HEADER_26:
We rely on revenue from subscriptions and service contracts, and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions and service contracts over the term of the relevant subscription or service period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our results of operations.
HEADER_27:
Because we depend on a limited number of manufacturers to build the appliances used in our platform, we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and customers.

HEADER_30:
We incorporate technology from third parties into our products, and our inability to obtain or maintain rights to the technology could harm our business.

HEADER_34:
The sales prices of our products, subscriptions and services may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.
HEADER_35:
Managing the supply of our products and their components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
HEADER_36:
Because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our customers and may result in the loss of sales and customers.
HEADER_37:
Our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.
HEADER_38:
Our technology alliance partnerships expose us to a range of business risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.

The accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the convertible notes, is subject to changes that could have a material effect on our reported financial results.
HEADER_58:
Conversion of our convertible notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and may depress the price of our common stock.
HEADER_59:
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
HEADER_60:
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
HEADER_61:
We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which would cause our stock price to decline
HEADER_62:
The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.
HEADER_63:
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or sales of our common stock by our executive officers and directors under Rule 10b5-1 plans, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
