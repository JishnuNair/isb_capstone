) (the &#8220;ECJ Ruling&#8221;), the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework was deemed an invalid method of compliance with restrictions set forth in EU Directive 95/46/EC (and member states&#8217; implementations thereof) regarding the transfer of personal data outside of the EU. On February 3, 2016, however, the EU and U.S. authorities agreed on the broad principals of a new &#8220;Safe Harbor 2.0&#8221; regime to replace the Safe Harbor Framework which had been invalidated. In light of the ECJ Ruling, it is possible that some of the other adequate protection measures we have adopted to legitimize the transfer of personal data may also be vulnerable to challenge by the ECJ in the same vein as the Safe Harbor Framework. We anticipate engaging in additional measures to ensure compliance with EU law with respect to our transfers of personal data from 
24

 
the EU to the U.S., and may find it necessary or desirable to make other changes to our personal data handling in light of the ECJ Ruling. These changes may entail, for example, adopting measures to ensure compliance with Safe Harbor 2.0 and/or to ensure the other adequate protection measures remain compliant. We may be unsuccessful in establishing compliant means for us to transfer such personal data from the EU or otherwise responding to the ECJ Ruling, and we may experience reluctance or refusal by European or multinational customers to use our solutions as a result of the ECJ Ruling. We may face a risk of enforcement actions taken by EU data protection authorities until the time, if any, that personal data transfers to us and by us from the EU are legitimized under EU Directive 95/46/EC and applicable member states&#8217; implementations thereof.
Additionally, the text of a new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been approved, which strengthens the existing data protection regulations in the EU. The GDPR is set to enter into full force during 2018 and its provisions increasing the maximum level of fines that EU regulators may impose to the greater of &#8364;100 million or 4% of worldwide annual sales. Such fines would be in addition to the rights of individuals to sue for damages in respect of any data privacy breach which causes them to suffer loss. As Internet commerce and communication technologies continue to evolve, thereby increasing online service providers&#8217; and network users&#8217; capacity to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process and transmit large volumes of personal information, increasingly restrictive regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, a variety of regulations that would increase restrictions on online service providers in the area of data privacy are currently being proposed, both in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulation in the field of data privacy and security is likely, possibly as restrictive as the EU model. Canadian, anti-spam legislation, or CASL, prescribes certain rules regarding the use of electronic messages for commercial purposes that took effect on July 1, 2014. CASL also contains provisions that took effect in January 2015, imposing certain restrictions on a service provider&#8217;s ability to electronically automatically update or change software used in a customer&#8217;s service without the customer&#8217;s consent. Penalties for non-compliance with CASL are considerable, including administrative monetary penalties of up to $10 million and a private right of action, and the CRTC has begun actively enforcing the law and penalization non-compliant organizations. Obligations and restrictions imposed by current and future applicable laws, regulations, contracts and industry standards may affect our ability to provide all the current features of our products and subscriptions and our customers&#8217; ability to use our products and subscriptions, and could require us to modify the features and functionality of our products and subscriptions. In 2015, Canada&#8217;s privacy legislation was amended to implement mandatory data breach notification requirements and fines of up to $100,000 per occurrence for organizations that fail to keep a log of breaches or notify the Office of the Privacy Commissioner or affected individuals. The amendments are not yet in force pending approval of related regulations, which is expected sometime in 2016. Such obligations and restrictions may limit our ability to collect, store, process, use, transmit and share data with our customers, and to allow our customer to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, transmit, share and disclose data with others through our products and subscriptions. Compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such obligations and restrictions could increase the cost of our operations. Failure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to data privacy and security could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity and other losses that could harm our business. 
Our customers can use our subscriptions to store contact and other personal or identifying information, and to process, transmit, receive, store and retrieve a variety of communications and messages, including information about their own customers and other contacts. Our terms of service prohibit the use of our subscriptions to store protected health information, or PHI (a category of information regulated under the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA), on a non-temporary basis and impose additional restrictions and conditions with respect to customers&#8217; use of our subscriptions to transmit or receive PHI or to store PHI on a temporary basis. Customers are able, and may be authorized under certain circumstances, to use our subscriptions to transmit, receive, and/or store PHI, and in such cases they must agree to the activation of our HIPAA conduit settings. In addition, RingCentral may execute Business Associate Agreements, or BAAs, which are HIPAA-defined contracts related to the security of PHI, with HIPAA-regulated customers. Noncompliance with laws and regulations relating to privacy and HIPAA or with contractual obligations under any BAAs may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities. Our actual compliance, our customers&#8217; perception of our compliance, costs of compliance with such regulations and obligations and customer concerns regarding their own compliance obligations (whether factual or in error) may limit the use and adoption of our subscriptions and reduce overall demand. Furthermore, privacy concerns, including the inability or impracticality of providing advance notice to customers of privacy issues related to the use of our subscriptions, may cause our customers&#8217; customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our subscriptions effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our subscriptions in certain industries. 
In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and industry groups have adopted and are considering the adoption of various self-regulatory standards and codes of conduct that, if applied to our or our customers&#8217; businesses may place additional burdens on us and our customers, which may further reduce demand for our subscriptions and harm our business. 
While we try to comply with all applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well as our own posted privacy policies and contractual commitments to the extent possible, any failure by us to protect our users&#8217; privacy and data, including as a result of our systems being compromised by hacking or other malicious or surreptitious activity, could result in a loss of user confidence in our subscriptions and ultimately in a loss of users, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 
25

 
Our customers may also accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that is lost or stolen, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, our third-party contractors in the Philippines, Russia, Ukraine, India and Poland may have access to customer data. If these or other third-party vendors violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers&#8217; information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
Use or delivery of our subscriptions may become subject to new or increased regulatory requirements, taxes or fees. 
The increasing growth and popularity of Internet voice communications heighten the risk that governments will regulate or impose new or increased fees or taxes on Internet voice communications services. To the extent that the use of our subscriptions continues to grow, regulators may be more likely to seek to regulate or impose new or additional taxes, surcharges or fees on our subscriptions. Similarly, advances in technology, such as improvements in locating the geographic origin of Internet voice communications, could cause our subscriptions to become subject to additional regulations, fees or taxes, or could require us to invest in or develop new technologies, which may be costly. In addition, as we continue to expand our user base and offer more subscriptions, we may become subject to new regulations, taxes, surcharges or fees. Increased regulatory requirements, taxes, surcharges or fees on Internet voice communications services, which could be assessed by governments retroactively or prospectively, would substantially increase our costs, and, as a result, our business would suffer. In addition, the tax status of our subscriptions could subject us to conflicting taxation requirements and complexity with regard to the collection and remittance of applicable taxes. Any such additional taxes could harm our results of operations. 
Our emergency and E-911 calling services may expose us to significant liability. 
The FCC requires Internet voice communications providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wire-line E-911 network. Under the FCC&#8217;s rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the caller&#8217;s phone number and registered location information to the appropriate public safety answering point, or PSAP, for the caller&#8217;s registered location. Our CLEC services are also required by the FCC and state regulators to provide E-911 service to the extent that they provide services to end users. 
In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or the CRTC, has imposed similar requirements related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the wireline incumbent carrier offers such 911 services. The CRTC also mandates certain customer notification requirements pursuant to which new customers are required to be notified of 911 service limitations and to consent to the same before their service with us commences and we are required to provide annual update notifications to our customers of the 911 limitations of our service. 
Additionally, as a provider of electronic communications services in the U.K., we are subject to regulation in the U.K. by Ofcom. Similar to the requirements in the U.S., Ofcom requires electronic communications providers, such as our company, to provide all users access to both 112 (EU-mandated) and 999 (U.K.-mandated) emergency service numbers at no charge. Ofcom also requires us to clearly and transparently inform our users of any emergency service limitations on their device including by way of labels and network announcements.
We provide E-911/999/112 service in compliance with the Ofcom, the CRTC and the FCC&#8217;s rules, as applicable, to substantially all of our customers&#8217; interconnected VoIP lines. In some circumstances, 911/999/112 calls may be routed to a national emergency call center that routes the call to the appropriate PSAP.&#160;In addition, certain of our Internet voice communications services that work with mobile devices and are accessed through Wi-Fi networks may not be able to complete 911/999/112 calls.&#160;The FCC is considering requiring providers of Internet voice communications services on mobile devices and softphones to provide E-911 service, if such service may be used to make calls to the public telephone network.&#160;In Canada, the CRTC requires providers of Internet voice communications services on mobile devices and softphones to provide E-911 service, if such service may be used to make calls to the public telephone network. The adoption of such a requirement in the U.S. could increase our costs and make our service more expensive, which could adversely affect our results of operations.
In May 2013, the FCC issued an order requiring all providers of interconnected text messaging services to provide, by September&#160;30, 2013, an automatic bounce-back text message in situations where a consumer attempts to text message to 911 and text-to-911 is not available. We believe we are in compliance with this order. On August 13, 2014, the FCC released an order that requires providers of interconnected text messaging applications, by December 31, 2014, to be capable of supporting the routing of text messages to 911 to the appropriate PSAP. Covered text messaging providers had until June 30, 2015, or six months from the date of a PSAP request, whichever is later, to implement the routing of text messages to 911 for that PSAP. We believe we are in compliance with this order.
In connection with the regulatory requirements that we provide E-911/999/112 to all of our interconnected VoIP customers, we must obtain from each customer, prior to the initiation of or changes to service, the physical locations at which the service will first be 
26

 
used for each VoIP line. For subscriptions that can be utilized from more than one physical location, we must provide customers one or more methods of updating their physical location. Because we do not validate the physical address at each location where the subscriptions may be used by our customers, and because customers may use the subscriptions in locations that differ from the registered location without providing us with the updated information, it is possible that E-911/999/112 calls may get routed to the wrong PSAP. We are also aware that certain customer registered addresses are incorrect, or may not have been updated. If E-911/999/112 calls or text messages are not routed to the correct PSAP, and if the delay results in serious injury or death, we could be sued and the damages substantial.&#160;We are evaluating measures to attempt to verify and update the addresses for locations where our subscriptions are used. The FCC is also considering requiring interconnected VoIP providers to automatically update subscriber location information, for purposes of routing 911 calls.
We could be subject to enforcement action by the FCC, the CRTC or Ofcom for our customer lines that cannot provide E-911/999/112 service in accordance with regulatory requirements. This enforcement action could result in significant monetary penalties and restrictions on our ability to offer non-compliant subscriptions. 
Customers may in the future attempt to hold us responsible for any loss, damage, personal injury, or death suffered as a result of delayed, misrouted or uncompleted emergency service calls or text messages. The New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 provides that Internet voice communications providers and interconnected text messaging providers have the same protections from liability for the operation of 911 service as traditional wire-line and wireless providers. Limitations on liability for the provision of 911 service are normally governed by state law, but these limitations typically are not absolute. It is also unclear whether the limitations on liability would apply to those customer lines for which we do not provide E-911 service. In the U.K., by law we cannot limit our liability for any death or injury arising out of our negligence, including as a result of emergency service calls that are delayed, misrouted or uncompleted due to our negligence. In Canada, the CRTC does not permit any limitation of liability related to the provision of E-911 services that is due to our gross negligence or where negligence on the part of a service provider results in physical injury, death or damage to the customer's property or premises. In addition, Canadian provincial consumer protection laws may constrain our ability to limit liability to our non-business customers for any liability caused due to the 911 shortfalls inherent in Internet voice communications services.
We rely on third parties to provide the majority of our customer service and support representatives and to fulfill various aspects of our E-911 service. If these third parties do not provide our customers with reliable, high-quality service, our reputation will be harmed, and we may lose customers. 
We offer customer support through both our online account management website and our toll-free customer support number. Our customer support is currently provided via a third-party provider located in the Philippines, as well as our employees in the U.S. We currently offer support almost exclusively in English. Our third-party providers generally provide customer service and support to our customers without identifying themselves as independent parties. The ability to support our customers may be disrupted by natural disasters, inclement weather conditions, civil unrest, strikes and other adverse events in the Philippines. Furthermore, as we expand our operations internationally, we may need to make significant expenditures and investments in our customer service and support to adequately address the complex needs of international customers, such as support in multiple foreign languages. 
We also contract with third parties to provide E-911 services and 999/112 services (in the U.K.), including assistance in routing emergency calls and terminating E-911/999/112 calls. Our providers operate a national call center that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to receive certain emergency calls and maintain PSAP (Emergency Call Handling in the U.K.) databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911/999/112 services. On mobile devices, we generally rely on the underlying cellular or wireless carrier to provide E-911/999/112 services. Interruptions in service from our vendors could cause failures in our customers&#8217; access to E-911/999/112 services and expose us to liability and damage our reputation. 
If any of these third parties do not provide reliable, high-quality service, our reputation and our business will be harmed. In addition, industry consolidation among providers of services to us may impact our ability to obtain these services or increase our costs for these services. 
We are in the process of expanding our international operations, which exposes us to significant risks. 
To date, we have not generated significant revenues from outside of the U.S., Canada and the U.K. However, we already have significant operations outside these countries, including software development operations in Russia and China, and software development and quality assurance operations in Ukraine, and sales and marketing operations in the Philippines, and we expect to grow our international presence in the future, including through the launch of our new Global Office solution. The future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the U.S. Due to our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales 
27

 
and distribution channels in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful. In addition, we will face risks in doing business internationally that could materially and adversely affect our business, including: 




 

&#183;

our ability to comply with differing and evolving technical and environmental standards, data protection and telecommunications regulations and certification requirements outside the U.S.; 




 

&#183;

difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations; 




 

&#183;

potentially greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; 




 

&#183;

the need to adapt and localize our subscriptions for specific countries; 




 

&#183;

the need to offer customer care in various native languages; 




 

&#183;

reliance on third parties over which we have limited control, including TELUS, BT and other international resellers, for marketing and reselling our subscriptions; 




 

&#183;

availability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion; 




 

&#183;

lower levels of adoption of credit or debit card usage for Internet related purchases by foreign customers and compliance with various foreign regulations related to credit or debit card processing and data protection requirements; 




 

&#183;

difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in foreign jurisdictions; 




 

&#183;

export controls and economic sanctions administered by the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and the Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control; 




 

&#183;

tariffs and other non-tariff barriers, such as quotas and local content rules; 




 

&#183;

compliance with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010; 




 

&#183;

more limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 




 

&#183;

adverse tax consequences; 




 

&#183;

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the price of our subscriptions outside of the U.S., increase the expenses of our international operations, including expenses related to foreign contractors, and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk; 




 

&#183;

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could reduce the amount of revenues we generate outside of the U.S. related to customer contracts that are denominated in local currencies of the countries we operate in, currently Canada and the U.K., or which could increase the expenses incurred in our operations or through our contractors outside the U.S. that are denominated in local currencies, currently the U.K., Russia, China, the Philippines and Ukraine; 




 

&#183;

exchange control regulations, which might restrict or prohibit our conversion of other currencies into U.S. Dollars; 




 

&#183;

restrictions on the transfer of funds; 




 

&#183;

our ability to effectively price our subscriptions in competitive international markets; 




 

&#183;

new and different sources of competition; 




 

&#183;

deterioration of political relations between the U.S. and other countries, particularly Russia, Ukraine, China and the Philippines; and including the possibility of a breakdown in diplomatic relations between the U.S. or the European Union and Russia or sanctions implemented by the U.S. or the European Union against Russia or vice versa, which could have a material adverse effect on our third-party software development operations in Russia; and




 

&#183;

political or social unrest, economic instability, conflict or war in a specific country or region, such as the recent events in the Ukraine, including political demonstrations, the annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine by Russia, the hostile relations between Russia and the Ukraine, and disruptions caused by Pro-Russian separatists in the Ukraine, which could have an adverse impact on our third-party software development and quality assurance operations there. 
Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall business.

Our future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our senior management and other key employees to execute on our business plan, and to identify and pursue opportunities and services innovations. The loss of services of senior management or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives. In particular, we depend to a considerable degree on the vision, skills, experience and effort of our co-founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vladimir Shmunis. None of our executive officers or other senior management personnel is bound by a written employment agreement and any of them may therefore terminate employment with us at any time with no advance notice. The replacement of any of these senior management personnel would likely involve significant time and costs, and such loss could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees for any reason could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
If we are unable to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business will suffer. 
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for highly skilled technical and other personnel with experience in our industry in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, in Denver, Colorado, where our U.S. sales and customer support office and our network operations center is located, and in other locations, such as Charlotte, North Carolina; Boca Raton, Florida; London, England and Xiamen, China, where we maintain offices. We must provide competitive compensation packages and a high-quality work environment to hire, retain and motivate employees. If we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract qualified personnel to fill key positions, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, including the development, marketing and sale of existing and new subscriptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information. 
Volatility in, or lack of performance of, our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Many of our key personnel are, or will soon be, vested in a substantial amount of shares of common stock, stock options or restricted stock units. Employees may be more likely to terminate their employment with us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our Class&#160;A common stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed. 
We may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, each of which may divert our management&#8217;s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, increase expenses, disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations. 
Our business strategy may, from time to time, include acquiring or investing in complementary services, technologies or businesses, such as our recent acquisition of Glip, Inc. We cannot assure you that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, integrate or manage disparate technologies, lines of business, personnel and corporate cultures, realize our business strategy or the expected return on our investment, or manage a geographically dispersed company. Any such acquisition or investment could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. The acquisition and integration process is complex, expensive and time-consuming, and may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, product development and sales activities and operations of both companies, and we may incur substantial cost and expense, as well as divert the attention of management. We may issue equity securities which could dilute current stockholders&#8217; ownership, incur debt, assume contingent or other liabilities and expend cash in acquisitions, which could negatively impact our financial position, stockholder equity and stock price. 
Acquisitions and other strategic investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: 




 

&#183;

the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; 




 

&#183;

unanticipated costs and liabilities; 




 

&#183;

difficulties in integrating new products and subscriptions, software, businesses, operations and technology infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner; 




 

&#183;

difficulties in maintaining customer relations; 




 

&#183;

the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; 




 

&#183;

the diversion of the attention of our senior management from the operation of our daily business; 




 

&#183;

the potential adverse effect on our cash position to the extent that we use cash for the purchase price; 
29

 




 

&#183;

the potential significant increase of our interest expense, leverage, and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition;  




 

&#183;

the potential issuance of securities that would dilute our stockholders&#8217; percentage ownership; 




 

&#183;

the potential to incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and 




 

&#183;

the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures. 
Any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment. In addition, our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately, effectively, and in a timely manner could impair our ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities and other advances in technology, as well as on our revenues, gross margins and expenses. 
We may be subject to liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges and fees. 
Prior to March 2012, we did not collect or remit U.S. state or municipal sales, use, excise, utility user and ad valorem taxes, fees or surcharges on the charges to our customers for our subscriptions or goods, except that we have historically complied with the collection of certain California sales/use taxes and financial contributions to the California 9-1-1 system (the Emergency Telephone Users Surcharge) and federal USF. For periods prior to 2012, with limited exception, we believe that we were generally not subject to taxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by other U.S. state and municipal jurisdictions or that such taxes, fees, or surcharges did not apply to our service. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient &#8220;in state presence&#8221; for a state to levy taxes, fees and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. Therefore, taxing authorities may challenge our position and may decide to audit our business and operations with respect to sales, use, telecommunications and other taxes, which could result in increased tax liabilities for us or our customers, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our relationships with our customers. 
In 2012, we voluntarily began collecting and remitting U.S. state sales, use or other taxes, surcharges, and fees. The collection of these taxes, fees, or surcharges could have the effect of decreasing or eliminating price advantages we may have had over other providers. We may not accurately calculate these taxes, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have recorded a contingent sales tax liability for sales prior to 2012. If our ultimate liability exceeds the collected and accrued amount, it could result in significant charges to our earnings. 
Finally, the application of other indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value added tax, or VAT, goods and services tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses, such as ours, is a complex and evolving area. In November 2007, the U.S. federal government enacted legislation extending the moratorium on states and other local authorities imposing access or discriminatory taxes on the Internet. Since then it has been extended several times, with the current continuing resolution extending it until October, 2016. This moratorium does not prohibit federal, state, or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting taxes that are due under existing tax rules. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in the U.S. or internationally, could have adverse effects on our business, prospects, and results of operations. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business. 
Changes in effective tax rates, or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: 




 

&#183;

changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; 




 

&#183;

expiration of, or lapses in, the research and development tax credit laws; 




 

&#183;

expiration or non-utilization of net operating loss carryforwards; 




 

&#183;

tax effects of share-based compensation; 




 

&#183;

expansion into new jurisdictions; 




 

&#183;

potential challenges to and costs related to implementation and ongoing operation of our intercompany arrangements; 




 

&#183;

changes in tax laws and regulations and accounting principles, or interpretations or applications thereof; and




 

&#183;

certain non-deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions. 
Any changes in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.
