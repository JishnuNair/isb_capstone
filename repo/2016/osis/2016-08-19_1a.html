<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We face aggressive competition in each of our operating divisions. If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in each of our divisions. In the security and inspection and patient
monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems markets, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, cost, prior customer relationships,
technological capabilities of the product, price, certification by government authorities, past performance, local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization. In the optoelectronic
devices and electronics manufacturing markets, competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of
delivery, price, customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully-integrated services from application development and
design through volume subsystem production. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and enhance our existing products
and services in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge and entire product lines or
service offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines or service offerings. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The September&nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks, subsequent attacks in other locations worldwide and the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have increased
financial expectations that may not materialize.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September&nbsp;11, 2001 terrorist attacks and subsequent attacks in other locations worldwide have created increased interest in
our security and inspection systems and service offerings. However, we are not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as it is now. We do not know what solutions will continue
to be adopted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Defense, and similar agencies in other countries and whether our products will be a part of those solutions.
Additionally, should our products and services be considered as a part of future security solutions, it is unclear what the demand for our products and services may be and how quickly funding to
purchase our products and services may be made available. These factors may adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If operators of, or algorithms installed in, our security and inspection systems fail to detect weapons, explosives or other devices or materials that are used to commit a
terrorist act, we could be exposed to product and professional liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing, sale and service of
security and inspection systems as well as in the provision of training to our customers in the use and operation of such systems. Our customers use our security and inspection systems to help them
detect items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. Some of our security and inspection systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag,
parcel, container or other vessel. Others signal to the operator that further investigation is required. In either case, the training, reliability and competence of the customer's operator are crucial
to the detection of suspicious items. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security
inspection systems that signal to the operator that further investigation is required are sometimes referred to in the security industry as "automatic" detection systems. Such
systems utilize software algorithms (often designed to meet government requirements) to interpret data produced by the system and to signal to the operator when a dangerous object may be present. Such
algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are also subject to significant technical limitations. Nevertheless, if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other
contraband was in fact present, resulting in significant damage, we could become the subject of significant product liability claims. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
security inspection by technological means is circumstance and application-specific. Our security and inspection systems are not designed to work under all circumstances and
can malfunction. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also offer turnkey security screening solutions under which we perform certain of the security screening tasks that have historically been performed by our customers. Such tasks
include: design, layout and construction of the security checkpoint where the inspection equipment is located; selection of the security equipment to be used at the checkpoint; selection, training and
management of the personnel operating the checkpoint; operation of the security screening equipment; interpretation of the images and other signals produced by the security screening equipment;
maintenance and security of the checkpoint as well as other related services. Such projects expose us to certain professional liability risks that are inherent in performing security inspection
services (in live checkpoint environments and over extended periods of time) for the purpose of assisting our customers in the detection of contraband items, including items that could be used in
performing terrorist acts or other crimes. If a contraband item were to pass through the checkpoint and be used to perform a terrorist act or other crime, we could become the subject of significant
professional liability claims. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims should an act of terrorism occur. Past terrorism attacks in the U.S. and in other
locations worldwide and the potential for future attacks have caused commercial insurance for such threats to become extremely difficult to obtain. Although we have been able to obtain insurance
coverage, it is likely that, should we be found liable following a major act of terrorism, the insurance we currently have in place would not fully cover the claims for damages. </FONT></P>

The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act) may not shield us against all legal claims we may face following an act of terrorism.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAFETY Act provides important legal liability protections for providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services. Under
the SAFETY Act, providers, such as our Security division, may apply to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for coverage of the products and services. If granted coverage, such providers would
receive certain legal protections against product liability, professional liability and certain other claims that could arise following an act of terrorism. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have applied to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for many of the products and services offered by our Security division but we do not enjoy coverage (or the highest level of
coverage) for every product
line, model number and service offering that our Security division provides. In addition, the terms of the SAFETY Act coverage decisions awarded to us by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
contain conditions and requirements that we may not (or may not be able to) continue to satisfy in the future. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the future, if we fail to maintain the coverage that we currently enjoy or fail to timely apply for coverage for new products and services as we introduce them, or if the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security limits the scope of any coverage previously awarded to us, denies us coverage or continued coverage for a particular product, product line or service offering, or
delays in making decisions about whether to grant us coverage, we may become exposed to legal claims that the SAFETY Act was otherwise designed to prevent. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
SAFETY Act was not designed to shield providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services from all types of claims that may arise from acts of terrorism, including from many
types of claims lodged in courts outside of the United States or acts of terrorism that occur outside of the United States. This too could leave us exposed to significant legal claims and litigation
defense costs despite the SAFETY Act awards we have received. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development, manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, product recalls
and, sometimes, product failure claims. We face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death.
Substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry. Some of our patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems products may become subject to product
liability claims and/or product recalls. Future product liability claims and/or product recall costs may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages or such insurance may not continue to be available
to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, a significant product liability claim or product recall could significantly damage our reputation for producing safe, reliable and
effective products, making it more difficult for us to market and sell our products in the future. Consequently, a product liability claim, product recall or other claim could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. </FONT></P>

Government agencies and some other agencies with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event we generally may recover only our
incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If an agency terminates a contract with us for default, we may be denied any recovery and may be
liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. We may receive notices under such contracts that, if not addressed to the agency's
satisfaction, could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts. The U.S. Government or regulatory agencies may initiate
civil False Claims Act litigation against us based on allegations related to our performance of contracts for the U.S. Government, which can be expensive to defend and if found liable can result in
treble damages and significant civil penalties. The U.S. Government may also initiate administrative proceedings that, if resulting in an adverse finding against us or our subsidiaries as to our
present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in our company or our subsidiaries being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new
government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges and, if satisfying the requisite level of seriousness, in our debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government for a specified
term as well as being subject to other remedies available to the U.S. Government. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, subsidiaries within our Security division received a "show cause" letter in November 2012 from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and a related Notice for
Proposed Debarment from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in May 2013. Although, with respect to that "show cause" letter and Notice for Proposed Debarment, we were ultimately able to reach an
Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Government, which allowed us to continue with our current and future business with U.S. Government agencies, there is no assurance that we would be able to reach
a similar outcome with respect to any future proceedings that we may become involved. In addition, if our Security division fails to remain in compliance with its current Administrative Agreement, the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security could initiate debarment proceedings. </FONT></P>

The loss of certain of our customers, including government agencies that can modify or terminate agreements more easily than other commercial customers with which we

effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sell many of our products to prominent, well-respected institutions, including agencies and departments of the U.S. Government,
state and local governments, foreign governments, renowned hospitals and hospital networks, and large military-defense and space-industry contractors. Many of these larger customers spend considerable
resources testing and evaluating our products and our design and manufacturing processes and services. Some of our smaller customers know this and rely on this as an indication of the high-quality and
reliability of our products and services. As a result, part of our reputation and success depends on our ability to continue to sell to larger institutions that are known for demanding high standards
of excellence. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

Our revenues are dependent on orders of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems,
which may have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions often depend upon the decision of governmental
agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports, border crossing inspection sites, seaport inspection sites, military facilities and other security installations. In the case of turnkey security
screening solutions, the commencement of screening operations may be dependent on the approval, by a government agency, of the protocols and procedures that our personnel are to follow during the
performance of their activities. Sales outside of the United States of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental
agencies to build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities. Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems, turnkey security
screening solutions and our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes. During these approval periods,
we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future revenues that may not occur. If we fail to receive such revenues after expending such resources, such failure could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
U.S and foreign budget control provisions could reduce government spending, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), committing the U.S. Government to significantly reduce the
federal deficit over ten years. The BCA contains provisions commonly referred to as "sequestration", which call for substantial, unspecified automatic spending cuts split between defense and
non-defense programs that may continue for a period of ten years. The BCA also included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and
will stay in effect through 2024, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Likewise, various European governments have implemented or intend to implement austerity measures intended to reduce
government spending. Such measures may reduce demand for our products directly by affected governmental agencies and by our customers who derive revenues from these governmental agencies or
governmental healthcare programs. We cannot currently predict the impact of governmental spending reductions on us or our customers or whether and to what extent our business and results of operations
may be adversely harmed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If we fail to perform on our existing agreements to provide security screening solutions to customers after expending substantial resources, such failure could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our projects require the expenditure of substantial management and financial resources in anticipation of future revenue
generation. For example, in 2012, we entered into a
substantial six-year contract with the Mexican government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various sites throughout Mexico, which required substantial expenditures for capital
equipment and infrastructure. Although to date we have generated revenues from this project, if we fail to perform and thus don't receive continued revenues over the remaining life of the project
after expending such resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate that future contracts for turnkey
security screening solutions in other territories could also require the outlay and management of substantial financial resources for capital equipment and infrastructure. </FONT></P>

costs, but we do not have guaranteed long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers. In addition, for certain raw materials and subcomponents that we use, there are a limited number of potential
suppliers that we have qualified or that we are currently able to qualify. Consequently, some of the key raw materials and subcomponents that we use are currently available to us only from a single
vendor. The reliance on a single qualified vendor could result in delays in delivering products or increases in the cost of manufacturing the affected products. Any material interruption in our

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We contract with third-party vendors to service our equipment in the field. We have made such arrangements because sometimes it is more

in conjunction with a service agreement than would be the case if we were to maintain such spare parts independently. Any material interruption in the ability of our vendors to fulfill such service

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of long lead times and specialized product designs, in certain cases we purchase components and manufacture products in

might impact production planning, our customers might not purchase
all the products that we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components. In any such event, we would attempt to recoup material and manufacturing costs by means such as returning
components to our vendors, disposing of excess inventory through other channels, or requiring our OEM customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory. However, some of our
significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our OEM customers to do this. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs, this could
adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,
because of the complex customer acceptance criteria associated with some of our products, on some occasions, products whose title has passed to our customers are still included in our inventory until

Our global operations expose us to legal compliance risks related to certain anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery
or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. It also requires us to maintain specific record-keeping standards and adequate internal
accounting controls. In addition, we are subject to similar requirements in other countries. Bribery, corruption, and trade laws and regulations, and the enforcement thereof, are increasing in
frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. Although we have internal policies and procedures with the intention of assuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees,
distributors, resellers and contractors involved in our international sales may take actions in violations of such policies. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent
or
deter our employees, distributors, resellers, contractors and/or other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-bribery, anti-corruption or similar laws and regulations, we may incur
severe fines, penalties and reputational damage. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and
regulations, including U.S. export control and customs regulations and customs regulations of other countries. These regulations are complex and vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate.
Any alleged or actual failure to comply with such regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our
products or to provide services outside the United States. Depending on severity, any of these penalties could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we perform manufacturing in multiple locations, we generally do not have redundant manufacturing capabilities in place for any
particular product or component. As a result, we depend on our current facilities for the continued operation of our business. A natural disaster, epidemic, terrorist act, act of war, or other natural
or manmade disaster affecting any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, or delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild, or
replace our manufacturing facilities. This delay could be lengthy and we could incur significant expenses to repair or replace the facilities. Any similar natural or manmade disaster that affects a

products.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we introduce any new and potentially promising product or service, or improve existing products or services with new features or
components, companies possessing competing technologies, or other companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights, may be motivated to assert infringement claims in order to generate
royalty revenues, delay or diminish potential sales and challenge our right to market such products or services. Even if successful in defending against such claims, patent and other intellectual
property related litigation is costly and time consuming. In addition, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation in order to protect our patent or other intellectual property rights, and even if
the claims are well-founded and ultimately successful such litigation is typically costly and time-consuming and may expose us to counterclaims, including claims for intellectual property
infringement, anti-trust, or other such claims. Third parties could also obtain patents or other intellectual property rights that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate
licenses from such third parties. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third
parties, and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, importing, distributing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have
a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies. Under any of these circumstances, we may incur
significant expenses. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to
our current and future success, and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans. The market for skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in technical
fields. While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, ultimately, we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key
employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans. In addition, we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All third-party payers, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the United States or outside, are developing increasingly
sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. These cost-control methods also potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. In the United
States, hospital and other healthcare provider customers, including physicians and ambulatory surgery centers, that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payers to cover all or a
portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures or tests in which our products are used and bill patients for any deductibles or co-payments. Because there is often no separate
reimbursement for our products, any decline in the amount payers are willing to reimburse our customers for the procedures and tests associated with our products could make it </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, and some could involve changes that could
significantly affect the ways in which doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems and health insurance companies are compensated for the services they provide, which could have a material impact on our
business. For example, the Affordable Care Act includes a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of a wide range of medical devices. The excise tax became effective in 2013 and increased our costs. Although
the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, signed into law in December 2015, includes a two-year moratorium (January&nbsp;1, 2016&nbsp;-&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2017) on the medical device
excise tax, it is not clear at this time whether the moratorium will be extended. Nor is it clear at this time to
what extent the Affordable Care Act may impact the ability of hospitals and hospital networks to purchase the patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems that we sell or if it
will alter market-based incentives that hospitals and hospital networks currently face to continually improve, upgrade and expand their use of such equipment. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts
by governmental and third-party payers to reduce healthcare costs or the implementation of new legislative reforms imposing additional government controls could cause a reduction

Substantial government regulation in the United States and abroad may restrict our ability to sell our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems, and

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively and rigorously regulate our patient monitoring,
diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems, including the research and development, design, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, clearance or approval, safety and efficacy, labeling,
advertising, promotion, pricing, recordkeeping, reporting, import and export, post-approval studies and sale and distribution of these products. In the United States, before we can market a new
medical device, or a new use of, new claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section&nbsp;510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act or approval of a premarket approval (PMA) application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is
"substantially equivalent" to a device legally on the market, known as a "predicate" device, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device
must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise
different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine
that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling
data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k) process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifications
to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval, and some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new

future products may not obtain FDA clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Further, the FDA makes periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers and in connection with such

issue a warning letter and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal penalties.
The expense and costs of any corrective actions that we may take, which may include product recalls, correction and removal of products from customer sites and/or changes to our product manufacturing

However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with our response to the warning letter or our proposed resolution of the outstanding issues. Until the items raised in the warning
letter are fully corrected, we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including the issuance of additional warning letters, injunction, seizure or recall of products, imposition of

Changes in laws affecting the healthcare industry could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, our business could be adversely affected by governmental actions, including
implementation of new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions; changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may
delay or prevent the approval of new products; and/or changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or
use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise
adversely affect the market for our products. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental
authorities may cause increased compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We must continually monitor the performance of our products once approved and marketed for signs that their use may elicit serious and unexpected adverse effects. Any recall
of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products that leads to corrective actions,
could have a material adverse impact on us.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we believe that existing data continue to support the efficacy and safety of our patient monitoring, cardiology, anesthesia
systems and defibrillator products, in the future, longer term study outcomes could demonstrate conflicting clinical effectiveness, a reduction of effectiveness,
no clinical effectiveness or longer term safety issues. This type of differing data could have a detrimental effect on the market penetration and usage of our medical device products. As a result, our
sales may decline or expected growth would be negatively impacted. This could negatively impact our operating condition and financial results. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More
generally, all medical devices can experience performance problems that require review and possible corrective action by us or a component supplier. We cannot provide assurance that
component failures, manufacturing errors, noncompliance with quality system requirements or good manufacturing practices, design defects and/or labeling inadequacies in any device that could result in
an unsafe condition or injury to the patient will not occur. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of
material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may also, under their own initiative, stop
shipment or recall a product if any material deficiency is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our
distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, noncompliance with good manufacturing practices or quality system requirements, design
or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Similar regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall products because of material deficiencies or defects in design or
manufacture that could endanger health. A recall involving our products could be particularly harmful to our business, financial and operating results. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Notice to the FDA of a correction or removal is
required when undertaken to reduce a risk to health, including when there is a reasonable probability that the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death, or when use of the
device may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or an outcome where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. In addition, companies are required
to maintain certain records of corrections and removal, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or similar foreign governmental authorities. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products
in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or foreign governmental authorities. If the FDA or foreign governmental authorities disagree with our determinations, they could
require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or a foreign governmental
authority could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted. </FONT></P>

on the corrective action we take to redress a product's deficiencies or defects, the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may require, or we may decide, that we will
need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled
devices in a timely manner. Moreover, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, civil penalties or
criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face material adverse publicity or regulatory consequences,

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the
courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other
things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or
specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a

and large single accounts such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, transactions with
customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts. The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure
on product pricing. If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants. Even if we are one of the selected
providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of products. Further, we may be required to
commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that market demand, governmental regulation,

and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and
implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. Government currently plays an important role in funding the development of certain of our security and inspection systems and

to us. If the government does not sponsor our technologies in the future, we may have to expend more resources on product development or cease development of certain technologies, which could
adversely affect our business. Government funded research and development also presents risks associated with government contracting </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that

minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture
of certain of our products. In addition, we incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in
our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to ascertain the origins for these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may

acquisition is completed, they will be entitled to receive a portion of the consideration for the acquisition, the payment of which could provide sufficient financial incentive for certain officers
and employees to no longer pursue employment with the combined business. If key employees depart
because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial incentives or a desire not to become employees of the combined business, we may incur significant costs in
identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, which could substantially reduce or delay our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. </FONT></P>

business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, AS&amp;E or the combined business, including our competitors or those of AS&amp;E. These disruptions could
have a material adverse effect on the businesses, operating results and financial condition of the combined business. The adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the
completion of the acquisition or termination of the merger agreement. </FONT></P>

own after the completion of the acquisition. In connection with that plan, we anticipate that we will incur certain non-recurring charges in connection with this integration; however, we cannot
yet identify the timing, nature and amount of all such charges. These transaction expenses and integration costs will be charged as an expense in the period incurred; although many of these
transaction costs may not be deductible for income tax purposes, thus, raising our effective tax rate. The significant transaction costs and acquisition-related integration costs could materially
affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded. Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies
related to the integration of the business, will offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near-term, or at all. </FONT></P>
