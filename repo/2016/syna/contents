We develop complex products in an evolving marketplace and generally warrant our products for a period of 12 months from the date of delivery.  Despite testing by us and our customers, defects may be found in existing or new products.  Manufacturing errors or product defects could result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenue, loss of market share, or failure to achieve market acceptance.  Additionally, defects could result in financial or other damages to our customers, causing us to incur significant warranty, support, and repair costs, and diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from key product development efforts.
Any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and harm our operating results.
We expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses and technologies in order to complement our current human interface solutions, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise create growth opportunities.  We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any future acquisitions.  We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify.  Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria.  Acquisitions may also become more difficult in the future as we or others acquire the most attractive candidates.  Unforeseen expenses, difficulties, and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.  If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders' percentage ownership, incur substantial debt, assume contingent liabilities, or experience higher operating expenses.
We may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the management, operations, facilities, and accounting and information systems of acquired businesses with our own; efficiently manage, combine or restructure the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations; achieve our operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses; achieve additional revenue as a result of our expanded operations; or achieve operating efficiencies or otherwise realize cost savings as a result of anticipated acquisition synergies.  The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including the following:




 

&#183;

the potential disruption of our core business;




 

&#183;

the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures;




 

&#183;

potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business;




 

&#183;

unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;




 

&#183;

diversion of management&#8217;s attention from our core business;




 

&#183;

problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies, or products;




 

&#183;

risks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience;




 

&#183;

failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results;




 

&#183;

adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;




 

&#183;

failure to retain key customers, suppliers, or personnel of acquired businesses;




 

&#183;

the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and




 

&#183;

the potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems.
We cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations, result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges, and adversely affect our business.

We have entered, and we anticipate that we will continue to enter, into strategic alliances.  We continually explore strategic alliances designed to enhance or complement our technology or to work in conjunction with our technology; to provide necessary know-how, components, or supplies; and to develop, introduce, and distribute products utilizing our technology.  Certain strategic alliances may not achieve their intended objectives, and parties to our strategic alliances may not perform as contemplated.  The failure of these alliances to achieve their objectives may impede our ability to introduce new products and enter new markets.
We must finance the growth of our business and the development of new products, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, marketing, and business development.  Our failure to sufficiently increase our net revenue to offset these increased costs would adversely affect our operating results.
From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to provide for funds required to expand our business, including through acquisitions.  We cannot predict the timing or amount of any such requirements at this time.  If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to expand our business or to develop new business at the rate desired and our operating results may suffer.  If obtained, the financing itself carries risks including the following:  (i) debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results; and (ii) equity financing, including the issuance of additional shares in connection with acquisitions, could result in dilution to existing stockholders and could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations outstanding under our credit agreement and other indebtedness we may incur from time to time.
We incurred a significant amount of indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of Renesas SP Drivers, Inc., or RSP, in fiscal 2015 (we refer to that acquisition herein as the &#8220;RSP Acquisition&#8221;). We entered into a credit agreement (which we refer to herein, as amended and supplemented, as the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or the Administrative Agent, as administrative agent for the Lenders, in connection with the RSP Acquisition. Our current and long-term bank debt incurred in connection with the close of the RSP Acquisition was approximately $250.0 million, and we have $150.0 million of undrawn availability in the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement. As of June 30, 2016, our current and long-term bank debt outstanding is $238.8 million.
Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including:




 

&#183;

making it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under the Credit Agreement or our other outstanding debt from time to time;




 

&#183;

risking an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, which could result in all of our bank debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to foreclose on the assets securing such debt;




 

&#183;

subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our debt with variable interest rates, including the debt incurred under the Credit Agreement;




 

&#183;

reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;




 

&#183;

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and




 

&#183;

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.
Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under the Credit Agreement or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
24
CONTENT_5:
The Credit Agreement includes certain covenants that limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things: (i)&#160;incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii)&#160;incur or suffer to exist liens securing indebtedness; (iii)&#160;make investments; (iv)&#160;consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; (v)&#160;sell assets; (vi)&#160;pay dividends or other distributions on, redeem or repurchase capital stock; (vii)&#160;enter into transactions with affiliates; (viii)&#160;amend, modify, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness; (ix)&#160;enter into certain restrictive agreements; (x)&#160;engage in a new line of business; and (xi)&#160;enter into sale leaseback transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that (i)&#160;restrict the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, (ii)&#160;require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be less than certain maximum ratio levels, and (iii)&#160;require the ratio of the amount of our consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense to be greater than a certain minimum ratio level.
If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default and could be accelerated, and could permit, in the case of secured debt, the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the Credit Agreement. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.
If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, we may incur significant expenses to remediate internal control deficiencies, lose investor confidence and our share price may decline.
We are subject to rules adopted by the SEC, pursuant to Section&#160;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, which requires us to include in our quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K, our management&#8217;s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal control over financial reporting.  We have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, however, we need to maintain our existing processes and systems and adapt such processes and systems as our business grows and changes. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with SOX is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain adequate and effective internal controls over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with SOX and SEC rules. Furthermore, as we grow our company or acquire other companies, our internal controls may become more complex and may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective.  Failure to comply with SOX and SEC rules, including a delay in or failure to successfully integrate new businesses into our internal control over financial reporting, a failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of such new or improved controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to not meet our reporting obligations. If we or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and expend significant management attention.  Failure to remedy any material weakness could result in inaccurate financial statements, an inability for the company to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, a loss in investor confidence, decline in the trading price of our common stock, restriction on access to worldwide capital markets, and sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
We expect to incur additional expenses in complying with corporate governance and public disclosure requirements.
Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including SEC regulations and Nasdaq Global Select Market rules, create uncertainty and increased expenses for companies such as ours.  New or changed laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.  We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure.  As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.  We expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources.

During the third quarter of calendar year 2012, the SEC adopted rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or Dodd-Frank.  These rules impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries.  Compliance with these rules results in additional costs and expenses, including costs and expenses incurred for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, and remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification efforts.  These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering &#8220;conflict free&#8221; minerals that can be used in our products.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.
Repatriation of our foreign earnings to the United States or changes in tax laws may adversely affect our future reported tax rates and financial results or the way we conduct our business.
We consider the undistributed operating earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, which totaled approximately $680.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2016, to be indefinitely invested outside the United States and have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed operating earnings.  Proposals to reform U.S. tax laws, including proposals that could reduce or eliminate the deferral of U.S. income tax on our foreign subsidiaries&#8217; undistributed earnings, could require those earnings to be taxed at the U.S. federal income tax rate.  If we do need to access our foreign subsidiaries&#8217; undistributed earnings for our domestic operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds, which would adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.  Additionally, if changes to tax laws or Tax Court decisions invalidate existing tax laws or regulations upon which we have relied, this could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.
If tax laws change in the jurisdictions in which we do business or if we receive a material tax assessment in connection with an examination of our income tax returns, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
We are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Our future effective tax rates and the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws in those jurisdictions. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws.&#160; Our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances, or interpretation, or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation.&#160; While we believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties, the resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations, or cash flows.
We face risks associated with security breaches or cyber attacks.
We face risks associated with security breaches or cyber attacks of our computer systems or those of our third-party representatives, vendors, and service providers.  Although we have implemented security procedures and controls to address these threats, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems.  If our systems, or systems owned by third parties affiliated with our company, were breached or attacked, the proprietary and confidential information of our company and our customers could be disclosed and we may be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including the following:  liability for stolen assets or information; costs of repairing damage to our systems; lost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack; loss of competitive advantage if our proprietary information is obtained by competitors as a result of such breach or attack; increased costs of cyber security protection; costs of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; damage to our reputation; and expenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber attack.  In addition, any compromise of security from a security breach or cyber attack could deter customers or business partners from entering into transactions that involve providing confidential information to us.  As a result, any compromise to the security of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or may be required to increase the cash element of our compensation program.
Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel.  Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs.

Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel.  Our compensation program, which includes cash and share-based compensation award components, has been instrumental in attracting, hiring, motivating, and retaining qualified personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to use our share-based compensation programs to effectively compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent without significantly increasing cash compensation costs.  In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel or we may be required to increase the cash elements of our compensation program to account for this disadvantage.
The accounting requirements for income taxes on certain of our share-based compensation awards may subject our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates to volatility.
We recognize a tax benefit upon expensing nonqualified stock options and deferred stock units, or DSUs, issued under our share-based compensation plans.  However, under current accounting standards, we cannot recognize that tax benefit concurrent with expensing incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares (qualified stock options) issued under our share-based compensation plans.  For qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, we recognize the tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur and, for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of the applicable accounting standards, the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid-in capital.  Accordingly, because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share-based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock, such disqualified dispositions may happen in periods when our stock price substantially increases, and because a portion of that tax benefit may be directly recorded to additional paid-in capital, our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates may be subject to volatility.
Our charter documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, and discourage a takeover.
Our certificate of incorporation and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when such attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders.  Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock.  Delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with &#8220;interested stockholders.&#8221;  Our certificate of incorporation divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with one class to stand for election each year for a three-year term after the election.  The classification of directors tends to discourage a third party from initiating a proxy solicitation or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and may maintain the incumbency of our Board of Directors, as this structure generally increases the difficulty of, or may delay, replacing a majority of directors.  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to fill vacancies or newly created directorships.  A majority of the directors then in office may elect a successor to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships, thereby increasing the difficulty of, or delaying a third party&#8217;s efforts in, replacing a majority of directors.
The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.
The trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following:




 

&#183;

variations in our quarterly results;




 

&#183;

the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance;




 

&#183;

changes in financial estimates by industry or securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates;




 

&#183;

various market factors or perceived market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us, our customers, our suppliers, or our competitors;




 

&#183;

announcements of technological innovations by us, our competitors, or our customers;
27





 

&#183;

introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us, our competitors, or our customers;




 

&#183;

acquisitions or strategic alliances by us, or our competitors, or our customers;




 

&#183;

recruitment or departure of key personnel;




 

&#183;

the gain or loss of significant orders;




 

&#183;

the gain or loss of significant customers;




 

&#183;

market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers, and the economy as a whole;




 

&#183;

short positions held by investors; 




 

&#183;

new federal and state laws and regulations affecting our industry; and




 

&#183;

general financial market conditions or occurrences, including market volatility resulting from geopolitical risks, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, financial market technological glitches and interruptions of trading activity.
In addition, stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies&#8217; operating performance.  Public announcements by technology companies concerning, among other things, their performance, accounting practices, or legal problems could cause the market price of our common stock to decline regardless of our actual operating performance.
