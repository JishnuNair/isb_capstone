We anticipate that our revenue and operating results will fluctuate, which could adversely affect the enterprise value of our Company and our securities.
HEADER_3:
In our Technology Solutions segment, we depend on a small number of OEMs to supply the IT and CE products and services that we sell and the loss of, or a material change in, our business relationship with a major OEM supplier, could adversely affect our business, financial position and operating results. 
HEADER_4:
In our Technology Solutions segment our gross margins are low, which magnifies the impact of variations in gross margin, operating costs and bad debt on our operating results. 
HEADER_5:
We are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our Technology Solutions customers, which could decrease revenue and adversely affect our operating results. 
HEADER_6:
We are subject to the risk that our inventory value may decline, and protective terms under our OEM supplier agreements may not adequately cover the decline in value, which in turn may harm our business, financial position and operating results.
HEADER_7:
We depend on OEM suppliers to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis, and any supply shortages or delays could cause us to be unable to timely fulfill orders, which in turn could harm our business, financial position and operating results. 
HEADER_8:
Our delivery center activities in our Concentrix business are significantly concentrated in India and the Philippines, which may expose us to operational risks.
HEADER_9:
Our systems design and integration solutions business has customer concentration and intense competition which could adversely impact our revenue. 
HEADER_10:
The market for CE products that we distribute is characterized by short product life cycles. Increased competition for limited retailer shelf space, decreased promotional support from resellers or retailers or increased popularity of downloadable or online content and services could adversely impact our revenue. 
HEADER_11:
The terms and conditions of our customer contracts within our Concentrix segment contain provisions which, if triggered, could cause fluctuations in our revenue, which in turn would adversely affect our financial results.

Our Concentrix business is subject to dynamic changes in its business model and intense competition, which in turn could cause our operations to suffer. 
HEADER_13:
If we are unable to hire and retain employees with domain expertise for our Concentrix business, our operations will be disrupted, and such disruption may impact our ability to manage our costs, which in turn could impact our profitability. 
HEADER_14:

We may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities.
HEADER_19:
We have pursued and intend to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions or investments in new markets and may encounter risks associated with these activities, which could harm our business and operating results. 
HEADER_20:
Because of the capital-intensive nature of our Technology Solutions business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business. 
HEADER_21:
The terms of our debt arrangements impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate which in turn could negatively affect our ability to respond to business and market conditions and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. 
HEADER_22:
We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations, which could adversely affect our business. 
HEADER_23:
If the interest rates on our borrowings increase, our access to capital and net income could be adversely affected.
HEADER_24:
A portion of our revenue is financed by floor plan financing companies and any termination or reduction in these financing arrangements could increase our financing costs and harm our business and operating results. 
HEADER_25:
We have significant credit exposure to our customers, and negative trends in their businesses could cause us significant credit loss and negatively impact our cash flow and liquidity position. 
HEADER_26:
We are dependent on a variety of IT and telecommunications systems and the Internet, and any failure of these systems could adversely impact our business and operating results. 
HEADER_27:
We rely on independent shipping companies for delivery of products, and price increases or service interruptions from these carriers could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
HEADER_28:
Because of the experience of our key personnel in the IT, CE and the customer engagement services industries and their technological and industry expertise, if we were to lose any of our key personnel, it could inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully. 
HEADER_29:
We may experience theft of product from our warehouses, water damage to our properties and other casualty events which could harm our operating results. 
HEADER_30:

HEADER_31:
We have significant operations concentrated in North and South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe and any disruption in the operations of our facilities could harm our business and operating results. 
HEADER_32:
Global health and economic, political and social conditions may harm our ability to do business, increase our costs and negatively affect our stock price.

HEADER_41:
OEMs could limit the number of supply chain service providers with which they do business, which in turn could negatively impact our business and operating results.

The IT and CE industries are subject to rapidly changing technologies and process developments, and we may not be able to adequately adjust our business to these changes, which in turn would harm our business and operating results.
HEADER_43:
