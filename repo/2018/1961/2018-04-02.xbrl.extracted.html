<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Our capital requirements have been and will
continue to be significant. Historically, we have been dependent on financings to fund our development and working capital needs.
As of December 31, 2017, we had only limited cash or cash equivalents. Accordingly, if we do not develop sources of revenues from
our patent portfolio, we would have to severely diminish our operations or halt them entirely. The opinion of our auditors contains
an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp;</P>

net losses as set forth in the financial information included herein. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant
losses for at least the short-term. We will not achieve profitable operations until we successfully develop sources of revenues
from our patent portfolio or generate revenues from other sources that are sufficient to offset our operating costs. We may never
be able to accomplish these objectives. Patent litigation is very expensive and we may not have sufficient cash available to pursue
any patent litigation to its conclusion because currently we do not generate revenues.&nbsp;</P>

resources and technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject us to significant liabilities or require
us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims

another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference
proceeding declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The
costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss
of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would prevail in
any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies if any, awarded against us would not be substantial. Claims of intellectual
property infringement may require us to enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all. We may also become subject to injunctions against the further development and use of our technology,

not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information on penny stocks
and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid
and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and if
the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer's presumed control
over the market, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. In
addition, broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally,
those persons with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse),
the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
