The following discussion is divided into three sections. The first section, captioned Risks Related to Our 
HEADER_2:
Common Stock, discusses some of the risks particular to an investment in our common stock. The second 
HEADER_3:
section, captioned Risks Related to Our Business, discusses some of the risks relating to our business 
HEADER_4:
operations. The third section, captioned Risks Related to Our Industry, discusses some of the risks 
HEADER_5:
the mailing and shipping technology industry in which we operate. You should carefully consider all of the 
HEADER_6:
following risks and the other information in this Report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange 
HEADER_7:
Commission (the SEC) before you decide to invest in our Company or to maintain or increase your 
HEADER_8:
investment. The risks included in this section are not the only ones we face. We operate in a very competitive and 
HEADER_9:
rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management 
HEADER_10:
to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the potential impact of all such risk factors on our business or 
HEADER_11:
the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those 
HEADER_12:
in any forward-looking statements. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of 
HEADER_13:
operations, financial condition and future prospects would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our 
HEADER_14:
common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
HEADER_15:
This Report contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and 
HEADER_16:
projections about us and the Internet. See the discussion of forward-looking statements on page 1 of Part I of

Several provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation and our

HEADER_26:
dilution to our stockholders and consume resources that may be necessary to sustain our business.

do not continue to, accept our 
HEADER_36:
services, our business will be adversely affected and could fail.

adversely affected if we fail to manage these vendors effectively.
HEADER_44:
Third party assertions of violations of their intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 
HEADER_45:

and our ability to generate cash will depend on many factors beyond our control. If we are unable to 
HEADER_68:
generate sufficient cash, our liquidity and financial condition would be adversely affected.
HEADER_69:
Our Credit Agreement imposes certain limitations on our ability to make dividend payments and to engage 
HEADER_70:
in further borrowing, which could hamper our control over liquidity.
HEADER_71:

HEADER_89:
and reputation may be adversely affected by the demands of compliance and/or by our liability for any 
HEADER_90:
failure to comply.
HEADER_91:
We do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions, and if such jurisdictions successfully 
HEADER_92:
challenged this practice, we could be subject to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our
