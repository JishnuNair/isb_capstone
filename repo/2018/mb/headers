Risks Related to Our Business
HEADER_4:
We have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.  In addition, our revenue growth rate may not sustain the levels experienced in recent years.  
HEADER_5:
If we fail to increase market acceptance of our platform, enhance and adapt our platform to changing market dynamics and customer preferences, or keep pace with technological developments, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects would be adversely affected. 
HEADER_6:
Our business depends substantially on our customers renewing, upgrading, or expanding their subscriptions to our platform and our ability to sell subscriptions to a large number of new small and medium-sized businesses on a consistent basis and in a cost-effective manner.  Any decline in the rate at which customers renew, upgrade, or expand their subscriptions could harm our future operating results.  
HEADER_7:
If pricing for our software subscriptions is not acceptable to our customers, our operating results will be harmed.
HEADER_8:
If our network or computer systems are breached, unauthorized access to customer or consumer data is otherwise obtained, or denial-of-service attacks occur, our platform may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, and we may incur significant liabilities.
HEADER_9:
Because our platform can be used to collect and store personal information, domestic and international privacy and data security concerns could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.
HEADER_10:
Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business and operating results.
HEADER_11:
Real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our platform could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.

HEADER_13:
Our payments platform is subject to U.S. and international rules and regulations, some of which are still developing.  If we fail to comply with such rules and regulations or if new laws, rules or practices applicable to payment systems restrict our ability to collect fees from our payments platform, our financial results could be materially and adversely effected.
HEADER_14:
If we incur an actual or perceived breach to our payments platform, we may incur significant liabilities and our brand and reputation may be damaged.

HEADER_23:
If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, then our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.
HEADER_24:
Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and adversely affect our operating results.
HEADER_25:
Our financial results may fluctuate due to increasing variability in our sales cycles resulting from, among other things, an expansion of the focus of our sales efforts to include larger organizations.
HEADER_26:
Our future performance depends in part on our reliance on third-party platforms to distribute our mobile applications, and support from our partner ecosystem.
HEADER_27:
We have in the past completed acquisitions, and we may in the future acquire or invest in companies.  Such acquisitions and investments divert our management’s attention and may in some cases result in additional dilution to our stockholders.  In addition, we may be unable to integrate the acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
HEADER_46:

HEADER_50:
Future sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.
HEADER_51:
The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
HEADER_52:
If our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, it may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock could decline.
HEADER_53:
If securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.
