We have, from time to time, increased the price of our software subscriptions and may do so again in the future. For example, we have implemented several price increases over the past few years, including most recently in February 2018 for some of our software levels.  We believe these increases have caused and may continue to cause customers to leave our platform, and such increases may also have reduced, and in the future may reduce, the number of new customers adopting our software.  We cannot guarantee that new or existing customers will adopt or renew subscriptions at our current prices.  Additionally, in the future we may further refine our tiered pricing model and our software levels, and/or increase pricing.  Such further changes may cause customers to migrate to lower level offerings or leave our platform entirely, which would adversely affect our customer numbers, and could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position and cash flow.

Use of our platform, including some of our third-party applications, involves the storage, transmission and processing of our customers&#8217; proprietary data, including personal or identifying information regarding their clients or employees.&#160;&#160;As a result, unauthorized access to, security breaches of, or denial-of-service attacks against our platform could result in the unauthorized access to or use of, and/or loss of, such data, as well as loss of intellectual property or trade secrets.If any unauthorized access to our systems or data, security breach, or significant denial-of-service attack occurs or is believed to have occurred, our reputation and brand could be damaged, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches or attacks and remediate our systems, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability, some or all of which may not be covered by insurance, and our ability to operate our business may be impaired.&#160;&#160;We have in the past and may in the future experience denial-of-service attacks against our platform.  If potential new customers or existing customers believe that our platform does not provide adequate security for the storage of personally identifiable or sensitive information or its transmission over the Internet, they may not adopt our platform or may choose not to renew their subscriptions to our platform, which could harm our business.&#160;&#160;Additionally, actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants.&#160;&#160;Our errors and omissions insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all potential liability.&#160;&#160;Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.&#160;&#160;We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for extended periods of time.16Table of ContentsBecause data security is a critical competitive factor in our industry, we make statements in our privacy policies and terms of service, through our certifications to privacy standards, and in our marketing materials, describing the security of our platform, including descriptions of certain security measures we employ.&#160;&#160;Should any of these statements be untrue, become untrue, or be perceived to be untrue, even if through circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face claims, including claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state, local or foreign regulators (e.g., a European Union-based data protection agency) or private litigants.

Our customers can use our platform to use, collect and store personal or identifying information regarding their employees and clients.&#160;Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction.&#160; The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by privacy-related laws, regulations and standards may limit the use or adoption of our platform, reduce overall demand for our platform, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, any of which could harm our business.&#160; Moreover, if our employees fail to adhere to adequate data protection practices around the usage of our customers' data, it may damage our reputation and brand.We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we may not be able to predict the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.&#160; For example, in April 2016, the EU Parliament formally adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which supersedes existing EU data protection legislation, imposes more stringent EU data protection requirements, and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance.  The GDPR will be effective in May 2018.  Complying with the GDPR has caused us to incur operational costs and divert attention from other operational priorities.  Our efforts to bring practices into compliance before the effective date of the GDPR may not be successful.  Additionally, in July 2016, the European Union and the United States adopted a new framework for legitimizing trans-Atlantic data flows, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.  Uncertainty remains as to whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and other legal mechanisms for the lawful transfer of data from the European Union to the United States will withstand legal challenges, whether from regulators or private parties.  If one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from Europe to the United States is invalidated, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.  Moreover, if our privacy and data policies and practices, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient, customer demand for our platform could decline, and our business could be negatively impacted.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and numerous state attorneys general are also applying federal and state consumer protection laws to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use and dissemination of personally identifiable information and other data.&#160;&#160;Some of these requirements include obligations on companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or our service providers.&#160;&#160;For example, our solutions must conform, in certain circumstances, to requirements set forth in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which governs the privacy and security of protected health information.&#160;&#160;Through the provision of online scheduling services to certain of our customers, we may collect, access, use, maintain and transmit protected health information in ways that may be subject to certain of these laws and regulations.&#160;&#160;Additionally, because we process a significant portion of our payments through debit or credit cards and enable our customers to engage in payments through our service, we are contractually required to maintain Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, compliance as part of our information security program.&#160;&#160; We also may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data.&#160;&#160;If we cannot comply with or if we incur a violation of any of these regulations or requirements, we could incur significant liability through fines and penalties imposed by credit card associations or other organizations or breach of contracts with our payment processors, either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.Finally, in March 2017, the U.K. government invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to initiate the process to leave the European Union, which follows the results of the referendum in June 2016 in which the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.&#160;&#160;The impact of the foregoing on data and privacy regulations in the United Kingdom remains uncertain.We may find it necessary to change our business practices or expend significant resources to modify our software or platform to adapt to new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning these matters.&#160;&#160;We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all.  Any failure to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines, penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.&#160;&#160;17Table of Contents

Our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers and consumers to access our platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time.&#160;&#160;Our platform is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering, operations and software development teams for our platform&#8217;s continued performance.&#160;&#160;In addition, we depend on external data centers to host our applications.  While we control and have access to our servers located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages and other performance problems related to our platform due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, delays in scaling our technical infrastructure if we do not maintain enough excess capacity and accurately predict our infrastructure requirements, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, denial-of-service attacks or other security-related incidents.&#160;&#160;For example, we have been the subject of denial-of-service attacks that have rendered our core software inaccessible for several hours.&#160;&#160;In addition, from time to time we experience limited periods of server downtime due to server failure or other technical difficulties.&#160;&#160;In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time.&#160;&#160;It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more complex and our user traffic increases due to, among other things, a growing number of customers and consumers originating from and demanding service in a greater number of countries.&#160;&#160;If our platform is unavailable or if our users are unable to access our platform within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, our business would be adversely affected and our brand could be harmed.&#160;&#160;In the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our infrastructure, customer or consumer data may be permanently lost.&#160;&#160;Moreover, our agreements with customers typically provide for limited service level commitments.  Our customers may be eligible for credits if we are unable to meet these service level commitments.&#160;&#160;If we experience significant periods of service downtime in the future, we may be subject to claims by our customers against these service level commitments.&#160;&#160;To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.

Because our platform is complex, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may occur, especially when updates are deployed or if there are issues with our secure access management procedures.&#160;&#160;Our platform is often used in connection with computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors in or failures of our platform or other aspects of the computing environments.&#160;&#160;In addition, deployment of our platform into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our platform.&#160;&#160;Despite testing by us, errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may not be found in our platform until after it is deployed to our customers or consumers.&#160;&#160;We have discovered, and expect to discover in the future, software errors, failures, vulnerabilities and bugs in our platform, and we anticipate that certain of these errors, failures, vulnerabilities and certain bugs can only be discovered and remediated after deployment to customers.&#160;&#160;Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them.&#160;&#160;In such an event, we may be required, or may choose for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem and or repair goodwill with our customers.

We may suffer an attack on our payments platform that results in a breach of consumer cardholder data.&#160;&#160;We maintain payment records of our customers and consumers on our payments platform, and we are a potential target for hackers and other parties attempting to steal card data via cyber-attacks or other means.&#160;&#160;As we increase our consumer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for these malicious third parties.&#160;&#160;If we experience any actual or perceived data breach as a result of third-party actions, employee negligence or error, or malfeasance, whether or not resulting in the unauthorized acquisition of or access to cardholder data, we could incur significant liability, our business may suffer and our brand and reputation may be damaged.&#160;&#160;We could be required to pay extensive fines and costs related to any such data breach, including costs incurred to replace cards and cardholder information and provide security monitoring services, and we could lose future sales and customers, any of which could harm our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;Such fines and costs could become due soon after such breach and exceed the amount of cash available to us, thereby impacting our ability to operate our business.&#160;&#160;In addition, a data breach or failure to comply with rules or regulations of payment systems could also result in the termination of our status as a registered Independent Sales Organization / Merchant Service Provider, thereby dramatically impairing our ability to continue doing business in the payments industry.

We depend on our third-party processing partners to perform payment processing services.&#160;&#160;Our processing partners may go out of business or otherwise be unable or unwilling to continue providing such services, which could significantly and materially reduce our payments revenue and disrupt our business.&#160;&#160;A number of our processing contracts require us to assume liability for any losses our processing partners may suffer as a result of losses caused by our customers, including losses caused by chargebacks and consumer or customer fraud.&#160;&#160;We have in the past and may in the future incur losses caused by chargebacks and fraud.&#160;&#160;In the event of a significant loss by our processing partners, we may be required to remit a large amount of cash following such event and, if we do not have sufficient cash on hand, may be deemed in breach of such contracts.&#160;&#160;In addition, our customers may be subject to quality issues related to products or services provided by our third-party processing partners or we may become involved in contractual disputes with our processing partners, both of which could impact our reputation and adversely impact our revenue.&#160;&#160;Certain contracts may expire or be terminated, and we may not be able to replicate the associated revenue through a new processing partner relationship for a considerable period of time.We have initiated and expect to continue to initiate new third-party payment relationships or migrate to other third-party payment partners in the future.&#160;&#160;The initiation of these relationships and the transition from one relationship to another could require significant time and resources.&#160;&#160;Due to non-solicitation obligations under our existing contracts, establishing these new relationships may be challenging.  Further, any new third-party payment processing relationships may not be as effective, efficient or well received by our customers and consumers, nor is there any assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with such processing partners.&#160;&#160;Our contracts with such processing partners may be less lucrative.&#160;&#160;For instance, we may be required to pay more for payment processing or receive a less favorable revenue arrangement from our payment processing partners.&#160;&#160;We may also experience the termination of revenue streams due to such migrations or be subject to claims relating to any disputes that could arise as a result of migrations.19Table of Contents

In the future, we may undertake to directly perform certain payment processing services that we currently depend upon our processing partners to perform, expand the scope of payment processing services we provide, offer additional payment processing services or otherwise undertake additional responsibilities and liabilities related to such payment processing services.&#160;&#160;For example, in the future, we may undertake to act as a registered payment facilitator or payment service provider of the payment systems, providing merchants with a suite of services, including payment processing and funding and accepting payments as the merchant of record on behalf of other merchants.&#160;&#160;As part of our dynamic pricing functionality, we have undertaken to act as a payment service provider and the merchant of record for those dynamically priced classes booked on our mobile applications, and we may undertake to expand our role as a payment service provider to other areas of our platform.  Any of these endeavors could require a significant investment of time and effective management of resources before presenting any potential upside for us, and may dramatically expand the scope of our potential contractual liability or exposure in the event of a lawsuit.&#160;&#160;Further, we may fail to effectively execute in performing such an expansion of services.

The market for business management software for the wellness services industry is fragmented and rapidly evolving, with relatively low barriers to entry.&#160;&#160;We face competition from in-house developed software systems, other software companies, and traditional paper-based methods.&#160;&#160;Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer.&#160;&#160;In addition, there are a number of companies that are not currently direct competitors but that could in the future shift their focus to the wellness services industry and offer competing products and services.&#160;&#160;Some of these companies, such as Intuit and Square, have or may in the future acquire greater financial and other resources than we do and could bundle competing products and services with their other offerings or offer such products and services at lower prices as part of a larger sale.&#160;&#160;There is also a risk that certain of our current business partners could terminate their relationships with us and use the insights they have gained from partnering with us to introduce their own competing products.&#160;&#160;Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and pre-existing relationships with customers, consultants, system integrators and resellers.&#160;&#160;Additionally, some potential customers in the wellness services industry, particularly large organizations, have elected, and may in the future elect, to develop their own business management software.&#160;&#160;Certain of our competitors have partnered with, or have acquired or been acquired by, and may in the future partner with or acquire, or be acquired by, other competitors to offer services, leveraging their collective competitive positions, which makes, or would make, it more difficult to compete with them.  Moreover, we may also face competition from wellness booking services for consumers, or other consumer app or website companies, particularly as we grow our consumer brand and awareness.  Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.&#160;&#160;With the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our platform and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.&#160;&#160;Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, increased churn, reduced customer retention, further losses or the failure of our platform to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.&#160;&#160;For all of these reasons, we may fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, and if such failure occurs, our business will be harmed.20Table of Contents

Increasing our customer base and number of active consumers, upgrading and expanding services to our existing customers, and achieving broader market acceptance of our platform will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities, including internationally.&#160;&#160;We are substantially dependent on our marketing organization to generate a sufficient pipeline of qualified sales leads and on our direct sales force to close new customers.&#160;&#160;From December&#160;31, 2016&#32;to December&#160;31, 2017, our sales and marketing organizations decreased from 493&#32;to 471&#32;employees.&#160;&#160;We plan to expand our direct sales and account development specialist workforce, both domestically and internationally.&#160;&#160;We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require.&#160;&#160;Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training, and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals.&#160;&#160;New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories.&#160;&#160;Our recent and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business.&#160;&#160;We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase, our existing customers will upgrade or expand their usage of our platform as we invest in our sales force, or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive.&#160; If our marketing organization does not generate a sufficient pipeline of qualified sales leads and our direct sales force is unable to close customers, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.

In deploying and using our platform, our customers depend on our 24/7 customer support team to resolve complex technical and operational issues, including ensuring that our platform is implemented in a manner that integrates with a variety of third-party platforms.&#160;&#160;We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for customer support or to modify the nature, scope and delivery of our customer support to compete with changes in customer support services provided by our competitors.&#160;&#160;Increased customer demand for customer support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.&#160;&#160;Our sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers.&#160;&#160;Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, our ability to sell our platform to existing and prospective customers, our business, operating results and financial position.

Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.&#160;&#160;If our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our Class&#160;A common stock could decline substantially.&#160;&#160;Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include but are not limited to:&#8226;our ability to attract new customers, retain and increase sales to existing customers and satisfy our customers&#8217; requirements;&#8226;the mix of our customer base, including the concentration of high value subscribers;&#8226;the volume of transactions processed on our payments platform;&#8226;the adoption of our fee-based dynamic pricing marketing services by our customers and consumers;&#8226;significant security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions to our platform and any related impact on our reputation;&#8226;the variability of revenues derived from our partners;&#8226;the number of employees added;&#8226;the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;&#8226;the entrance of new competitors in our market, whether by established companies or new companies;&#8226;changes in our or our competitors&#8217; pricing;&#8226;the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business, including our sales force, and expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses;21Table of Contents&#8226;new pricing models, products, features or functionalities introduced by us or our competitors;&#8226;the timing of payments by customers and other payment processing partners and payment defaults by customers or other payment processing partners;&#8226;litigation, including class action litigation, involving our company, our services or our industry;&#8226;general economic conditions or declines in consumer interest in the wellness industries that we serve, either of which may adversely affect either our customers&#8217; ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions, delay a prospective customer&#8217;s purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect customer retention;&#8226;changes in the relative and absolute levels of customer support we provide;&#8226;changes in foreign currency exchange rates;&#8226;extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;&#8226;the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and&#8226;the timing of the grant or vesting of equity awards to employees.Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to vary widely.  As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.

We believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork.&#160;&#160;However, as our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of such culture, and the failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to retain and attract the kind of employees necessary for our future success.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture, the quality of our products and services may suffer, which could adversely affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract customers.

Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Stollmeyer.&#160;&#160;We rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, operations, security, marketing, sales, support, general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors in our research and development and operations.&#160;&#160;We have experienced, and may in the future experience, changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business.&#160;&#160;We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period, and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time.&#160;&#160;The loss of one or more of our executive officers, especially our Chief Executive Officer, or other key employees, could have an adverse effect on our business.In addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.&#160;&#160;Competition for these personnel in the locations where we maintain offices is intense, especially in the San Luis Obispo area, where our headquarters is located, due in part to the relatively close proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area.&#160;&#160;We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications.&#160;&#160;In some cases, we have recruited employees from the San Francisco Bay Area and other regions with a greater supply of managerial, sales and engineering talent, and in such cases, we have sometimes found it necessary to offer compensation packages that were larger than would have been necessary if no relocation had been required.&#160;&#160;&#160;We also outsource some of our research and development to India, which requires compliance with security protocols. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are located in areas in which sales and engineering talent is more readily available.&#160;&#160;Moreover, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment.&#160;&#160;If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees may be adversely impacted.&#160;&#160;If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.&#160;&#160;22Table of Contents

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a differentiated and category-defining business management software company serving the wellness services industry and consumers through a two-sided marketplace is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and to our ability to attract new customers.&#160;&#160;The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality software, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services.The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we seek to expand our platform.&#160;&#160;To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur.&#160;&#160;If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
CONTENT_24:
Our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers.&#160;&#160;The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for business management software generally and for business management software serving the wellness services industry in particular.&#160;&#160;Historically, during economic downturns, there have been reductions in spending on information technology as well as pressure for extended billing terms and other financial concessions.&#160;&#160;The adverse impact of economic downturns may be particularly acute among small and medium-sized businesses, which comprise the vast majority of our customer base.&#160;&#160;If economic conditions deteriorate, our current and prospective customers may elect to decrease their information technology budgets, which would limit our ability to grow our business and adversely affect our operating results.
CONTENT_25:
We plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle.&#160;&#160;These assumptions are based upon historical trends for sales cycles and conversion rates associated with our existing customers, many of whom to date have been small to medium-sized organizations.&#160;&#160;As we expand our sales efforts to include larger organizations, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur higher costs and longer and more unpredictable sales cycles.&#160;&#160;With larger organizations, the decision to subscribe to our platform may require the approval of more technical personnel and management levels within a potential customer&#8217;s organization than we have historically encountered, and if so, these types of sales would require us to invest more time educating these potential customers.&#160;&#160;In addition, larger organizations may demand more features and integration and customer support services.&#160;&#160;We have limited experience in developing and managing sales strategies for larger organizations and in successfully onboarding larger organizations as new customers.&#160;&#160;As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may not prove to be successful or may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, customer support and professional services resources to individual customers, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability, and will likely lengthen our typical sales cycle, which could strain our resources.&#160;&#160;Moreover, these larger transactions may require us to delay recognizing the associated revenue we derive from these customers until any technical or implementation requirements have been met, and larger customers may demand discounts to the prices they pay for our platform.&#160;&#160;Other factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include but are not limited to:&#8226;our pricing terms;&#8226;the need to educate prospective customers about the uses and benefits of our platform;&#8226;lead generation, including both inbound and outbound;&#8226;the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;&#8226;the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing processes;&#8226;evolving functionality demands;&#8226;announcements or planned introductions of new products, features or functionality by us or our competitors; and&#8226;lengthy purchasing approval processes, particularly among larger organizations.23Table of ContentsIf we are unsuccessful expanding sales to larger organizations, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, if we are unable to close one or more expected significant transactions with customers in a particular period, or if one or more expected transactions are delayed until a subsequent period, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transactions would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected.

The numbers for certain of our key, user and other metrics, including, among others, active consumers, registered users of our applications and number of wellness practitioners employed by our customers, are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of customer and consumer accounts.  While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our platform, usage of specific features of our platform, and user information across large online and mobile populations around the world.  For example, we estimate that approximately 41 million&#32;active consumers used our platform during the two years ended&#32;December&#160;31, 2017.&#160;In calculating this number, we have attempted to avoid duplicative counting of consumers by identifying consumers who may have used our platform through different customers.&#160;&#160;However, in certain cases, a single consumer may have transacted with multiple customers under slightly different names, in which case there is a chance that we have counted the same consumer more than once.&#160;&#160;Given the challenges inherent in identifying whether a single consumer has engaged in transactions on our platform under different names, we do not have a reliable way of identifying the precise number of consumers using our platform.&#160;&#160; We are continuing to invest in our systems and controls to improve the precision and reliability of our metrics.  If third parties, including investors and analysts, do not perceive our metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, we may be subject to liability and our reputation may be harmed, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.25Table of Contents

In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we derived 19%, 17% and 16%, respectively, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States. We are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy.&#160;&#160;We currently have sales personnel and sales and customer support operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.&#160;&#160;Our sales organization outside the United States is substantially smaller than our sales organization in the United States.&#160;&#160;We believe our ability to convince new customers to subscribe to our platform or to convince existing customers to renew or expand their use of our platform is directly correlated to the level of engagement we obtain with the customer.&#160;&#160;To the extent we are unable to effectively engage with non-U.S. customers due to our limited sales force capacity, we may be unable to effectively grow in international markets.Our international operations subject us to a variety of additional risks and challenges, including:&#8226;compliance with foreign privacy, information security and data protection laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance;&#8226;differing technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;&#8226;requirements or customer requests for localized software and licensing programs, and localized language support;&#8226;increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having international operations;&#8226;uncertainty regarding the expected departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union;&#8226;increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;&#8226;longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivable or satisfying revenue recognition criteria, especially in emerging markets;&#8226;requirements or preferences for domestic products;&#8226;economic conditions in each country or region and general economic uncertainty around the world;&#8226;compliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. Travel Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010), import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our platform in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;&#8226;heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements;&#8226;fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effect on our operating results;&#8226;difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;&#8226;communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures and political systems;&#8226;differing labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries;&#8226;the need or customer requests for localized language support;&#8226;reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad; and&#8226;compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes.Any of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our international revenue or increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects.26Table of ContentsCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations substantially increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;We may be unable to keep current with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time.&#160;&#160;Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business.&#160;&#160;In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. or other regulations applicable to us.&#160;&#160;Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies.&#160;&#160;Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, partners, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, other collateral consequences, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our platform and services and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#160;201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities.&#160;&#160;Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector.&#160;&#160;We use third-party representatives to sell our products and services abroad.&#160;&#160;In addition, as we increase our international sales and business, we may engage with additional business partners and third-party intermediaries to sell our products and services abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals.&#160;&#160;We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities.&#160;&#160;We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.Noncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences.&#160;&#160;If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.&#160;&#160;In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.&#160;&#160;Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others.&#160;&#160;We believe this variability is largely due to our focus on the wellness services industry, as many of our customers experience an increase in demand for their services in the first quarter of each year due to their clients becoming more motivated to pursue health and fitness goals in the new year.&#160;&#160;Our rapid growth rate over the last couple years may have made seasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect.&#160;&#160;In addition, as we attempt to expand the number of our customers and consumers, we may see changes to this pattern of seasonality. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

We depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships in order to sustain and grow our business.&#160;&#160;We are highly dependent upon partners for certain critical features and functionality of our platform, including data centers and third-party payment processors supporting our payments platform.&#160;&#160;Failure of these or any other technology providers to maintain, support or secure their technology platforms in general, and our integrations in particular, or errors or defects in their technology, could materially and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays or difficulties in our ability to provide our platform until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained and integrated.27Table of ContentsIdentifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with strategic third parties such as payments partners, API partners and technology partners requires significant time and resources.&#160;&#160;In addition, integrating third-party technology is complex, costly and time-consuming.&#160;&#160;Our agreements with these partners are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services.&#160;&#160;Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our platform.&#160;&#160;In addition, our partners could develop competing products or services.Our third-party partners may also suffer disruptions or weakness in their businesses unrelated to the relationships with us that could cause declines in their business performance.  Such occurrences could be harmful to our financial results and cause our stock price to decline.If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these strategic third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.&#160;&#160;Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in improved operating results.

We rely heavily on hosted SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including sales automation and pipeline management, billing and order management, customer support, access to our API, IT support, enterprise resource planning, payroll and financial accounting services.&#160;&#160;If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions, security vulnerabilities or cyber-attacks, including prolonged denial-of-service attacks, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our platform and supporting and communicating with our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.Our ability to provide services and solutions to our customers also depends on our ability to communicate with our customers through the public Internet and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties.&#160;&#160;In addition, in order to provide services on-demand and promptly, our computer equipment and network servers must be functional 24 hours per day, which requires access to telecommunications facilities managed by third parties and the availability of electricity, which we do not control.&#160;&#160;A severe disruption of one or more of these networks, including as a result of utility or third-party system interruptions, could impair our ability to process information, which could impede our ability to provide services to our customers, harm our reputation, result in a loss of customers and adversely affect our business and operating results.

Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property.&#160;&#160;We currently have twelve pending patent applications, but there is no guarantee that such applications will result in issued patents.&#160;&#160;We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights.&#160;&#160;However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.To protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights.&#160;&#160;Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights.&#160;&#160;Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.

We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, loan facilities, financing agreements for software and license maintenance and subscription payments by our customers for use of our platform.&#160; For instance, in May 2017, we completed a follow-on public offering in which we issued and sold 5,060,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $27.95 per share.&#160;In the future, we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, and we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, or unforeseen circumstances.&#160;&#160;We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all.&#160;&#160;Any debt financing obtained by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.&#160;&#160;If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class&#160;A common stock.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.

Borrowings under our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.&#160;&#160;In addition, borrowings under our loan agreement are based on a percentage of our monthly recurring revenue for the prior months, up to $20 million, with an accordion feature that allows for additional borrowings under our loan agreement in an aggregate amount of $20 million, upon our request and subject to certain conditions. If our revenue declines, our ability to draw under the loan agreement could be adversely affected or if we were to draw under the loan agreement, a decline in our revenue could force us to repay all or a portion of the outstanding loan earlier than we may have originally anticipated.Our loan agreement also restricts our ability to, among other things:&#8226;sell or otherwise dispose of our assets;&#8226;make material changes in our business;&#8226;enter into a transaction in which stockholders who were not stockholders immediately prior to such transaction own more than 40% of our voting stock after giving effect to such transaction;29Table of Contents&#8226;consolidate, merge with, or acquire other entities;&#8226;incur additional indebtedness;&#8226;create liens on our assets;&#8226;pay dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock;&#8226;make investments;&#8226;enter into transactions with affiliates; and&#8226;pay off or redeem subordinated indebtedness.These restrictions are subject to certain exceptions.&#160;&#160;The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the loan agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, could restrict our ability to finance our operations and to engage in, expand or otherwise pursue business activities and strategies that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial.&#160;&#160;Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan agreement.The loan agreement also contains customary events of default, subject to cure periods for certain defaults, including, among others, payment defaults, covenant defaults, the occurrence of a material adverse change in our business, defaults relating to certain legal processes affecting our assets or business, insolvency and bankruptcy defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, material judgment defaults and material misrepresentations.&#160;&#160;Future defaults, if not waived, could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreement to become immediately due and payable and would permit Silicon Valley Bank to terminate all commitments to extend further credit and exercise remedies against the collateral in which we granted Silicon Valley Bank a security interest.If we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.&#160;&#160;This could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.

We conduct transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.&#160;&#160;While we have primarily transacted with customers and vendors in U.S. dollars, we have transacted in foreign currencies for subscriptions to our platform and expect to significantly expand the number of transactions with customers for our platform that are denominated in foreign currencies in the future.&#160;&#160;As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations.&#160;&#160;In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including, any fluctuations resulting from uncertainties relating to the expected departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our Class&#160;A common stock could be adversely affected.We do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies.&#160;&#160;However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.&#160;&#160;The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.&#160;&#160;Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.

We are subject to federal and state income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction.&#160;&#160;We do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable.&#160;&#160;Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future.30Table of ContentsSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.&#160;&#160;We generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;These determinations are highly complex and require detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials.&#160;&#160;In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.Although we believe our tax practices and provisions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, there could be a material effect on our tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made, which could materially impact our financial results.&#160;&#160;Further, any changes in the taxation of our activities, including recent changes in U.S. tax laws, may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.&#160;&#160;In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period.&#160;&#160;Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.

As of December&#160;31, 2017, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $118.0 million and $103.0 million, respectively, due to prior period losses, which, subject to the following discussion, are generally available to be carried forward to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire.  Our federal NOLs begin to expire in the year ending December&#160;31, 2025, and our state NOLs started to expire in 2016 for the earliest net operating loss layers.  In general, under Section&#160;382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income.&#160;&#160;Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed an analysis under Section 382 of the Code through December 31, 2014, and determined that we experienced multiple ownership changes during this period which will limit future utilization of NOL carryforwards.  U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $430,000 are expected to expire due to limitations under Section 382 and, as such, have not been reflected in the NOL carryforward above. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code.  Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.&#160;&#160;There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.&#160;&#160;For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability

The future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications.&#160;&#160;Federal, state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium.&#160;&#160;Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our platform in order to comply with these changes.&#160;&#160;In addition, government agencies or private organizations have imposed and may impose additional taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet.&#160;&#160;These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based platforms and services such as ours.&#160;&#160;In addition, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease-of-use, accessibility and quality of service.&#160;&#160;The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by &#8220;viruses,&#8221; &#8220;worms&#8221; and similar malicious programs, and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure.&#160;&#160;If the use of the Internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our platform could decline.31Table of Contents

Our corporate headquarters are located in San Luis Obispo, California, and we utilize data centers that are located in North America.&#160;&#160;Key features and functionality of our platform are enabled by third parties that are headquartered in California and operate or utilize data centers in the United States.&#160;&#160;Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services and sales activities.&#160;&#160;The west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones, both Northern and Southern California have experienced devastating wildfires, and Southern California has recently experiences significant flooding.&#160;&#160;In addition, the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant is located a short distance from San Luis Obispo.&#160;&#160;In the event of a major earthquake, hurricane or other natural disaster, or a catastrophic event such as a nuclear disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, war or terrorist attack, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our app development, lengthy interruptions in our platform, breaches of data security or data integrity and loss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our future operating results.

Our Class&#160;B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class&#160;A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who held shares of our Class&#160;B common stock as of December&#160;31, 2017, including, among others, our executive officers, employees and directors and their respective affiliates, collectively held approximately 47.5%&#32;of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of such date.&#160;&#160;Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class&#160;B common stock and Class&#160;A common stock, the holders of our Class&#160;B common stock will collectively continue to have significant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval.&#160;&#160;These holders of our Class&#160;B common stock may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests.&#160;&#160;The effect of this dual class structure may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class&#160;A common stock.Significant individual holders of our Class B common stock include our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Stollmeyer.&#160;&#160;If, for example, Mr. Stollmeyer retains a significant portion of his holdings of shares of our Class&#160;B common stock for an extended period of time, he could control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock for the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;In addition, Mr. Stollmeyer holds an irrevocable proxy to vote certain shares of our Class A common stock and Class&#160;B common stock held by certain of our stockholders. As a board member, Mr. Stollmeyer owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Stollmeyer is entitled to vote his shares in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.
