Item 1A. Risk Factors
HEADER_2:
An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks and uncertainties. If any of these risks actually occurs, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.

HEADER_9:
We may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability in the future. 
HEADER_10:
If we fail to manage our operating expenses effectively, our financial performance may be negatively impacted.
HEADER_11:
Because some of the key components in our products come from a limited number or single source of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain. 
HEADER_12:
Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key employees, including our founders, James Park and Eric N. Friedman, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management.
HEADER_13:
We spend significant amounts on advertising and other marketing campaigns to acquire new users, which may not be successful or cost effective.
HEADER_14:
Our current and future products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in adverse publicity, product recalls, litigation, regulatory proceedings, and warranty claims resulting in significant direct or indirect costs, decreased revenue and operating margin, and harm to our brand. 
HEADER_15:
We rely on a limited number of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers, and each of our products is manufactured by a single contract manufacturer. 
HEADER_16:
We have limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers, which subjects us to significant risks, including the potential inability to obtain or produce quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.

HEADER_20:
We depend on retailers and distributors to sell and market our products, and our failure to maintain and further develop our sales channels could harm our business. 
HEADER_21:
Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products. 
HEADER_22:
Our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand. If events occur that damage our brand, our business and financial results may be harmed. 
HEADER_23:
Our business is affected by seasonality and if our sales fall below our forecasts, our overall financial conditions and operating results could be adversely affected.
HEADER_24:
We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and any security breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations could harm our business. 
HEADER_25:
Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations. 
HEADER_26:
Any material disruption of our information technology systems, or those of third-party partners and data center providers could materially damage user and business partner relationships, and subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.

HEADER_28:
We may experience difficulties implementing and maintaining our new enterprise resource planning system. 
HEADER_29:
The market for wearable devices is still in the early stages of growth and if it does not continue to grow, grows more slowly than we expect, or fails to grow as large as we expect, our business and operating results would be harmed.
HEADER_30:
Our active user metric only represents the potential size and growth of our engaged user community and our activation metric is only an indicator of potential repeat behavior. Therefore, you should not rely on the active user metrics as an indicator of future retention of users, continual user engagement, or future payments by users or the activation metric as a guarantee of repeat purchasing behavior.
HEADER_31:
Our failure to comply with U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security, and data protection, such as European data protection law, which requires an adequate legal mechanism for the transfer of personal data outside of Europe, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and our brand.

HEADER_33:
Our international operations subject us to additional costs and risks, and our continued expansion internationally may not be successful.

HEADER_43:
There have been reports that some users of certain of our devices have experienced skin irritations, which could result in additional negative publicity or otherwise harm our business. In addition, some of our users have filed personal injury lawsuits against us relating to certain of our devices, which could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees and other costs. 
HEADER_44:
We may be subject to CPSC recalls, regulatory proceedings and litigation in various jurisdictions, including multi-jurisdiction federal and state class action and personal injury claims, which may require significant management attention and disrupt our business operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and our brand.

Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that they might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
HEADER_55:
The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our founders and certain other holders of our Class B common stock, including our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval.
HEADER_56:
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.
