Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, it is difficult to reliably predict future revenues and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results. Factors that may affect our operating results and/or the market price of our Common Stock include, but are not limited to:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			demand for and market acceptance of our products;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			low or fluctuating levels of political stability in regions in which we do business;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			adverse changes in industries on which we are particularly dependent;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			delays or problems in the introduction of new products;

Our international sales and our operations in foreign countries expose us to risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange rates. Gains and losses on the conversion of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations. In addition, since we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

CONTENT_7:
We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks, and we believe our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. However, the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. While some of our products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.
CONTENT_8:
The development, manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, product recalls and, sometimes, product failure claims. We face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death. Substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry. Some of our patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems products may become subject to product liability claims and/or product recalls. Future product liability claims and/or product recall costs may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, a significant product liability claim or product recall could significantly damage our reputation for producing safe, reliable and effective products, making it more difficult for us to market and sell our products in the future. Consequently, a product liability claim, product recall or other claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

CONTENT_9:
Quality is extremely important to us and our customers, due in part to the serious consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical both to the marketing success of our goods and services and to the satisfaction of both regulatory and contractual requirements under which we sell many of our products. If we fail to meet these standards or other standards required in our industries, we could lose customers and market share, our revenue could decline and we could face significant costs and other liabilities.
CONTENT_10:

CONTENT_11:

CONTENT_12:
We sell many of our products to prominent, well&#8209;respected institutions, including agencies and departments of the U.S. Government, state and local governments, foreign governments, renowned hospitals and hospital networks, and large military&#8209;defense and space&#8209;industry contractors. Many of these larger customers spend considerable resources testing and evaluating our products and our design and manufacturing processes and services. Some of our smaller customers know this and rely on this as an indication of the high&#8209;quality and reliability of our products and services. As a result, part of our reputation and success depends on our ability to continue to sell to larger institutions that are known for demanding high standards of excellence.
		
		
			The loss or termination of a contract by such an institution, even if for reasons unrelated to the quality of our products or services, could therefore have a more wide&#8209;spread and potentially material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
		
		
			Further, we are generating revenues from certain customers, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, in fiscal 2012, we entered into a six&#8209;year contract with the Mexican government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various locations throughout the country. This project is expected to provide significant revenues over the life of the contract. The termination, non&#8209;renewal or reduction in scope of this contract, even if for reasons unrelated to the quality of our products or services, could therefore have a more wide&#8209;spread and potentially material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to impairment of capital assets purchased or manufactured specifically for this contract.
CONTENT_13:
Sales of security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions often depend upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports, border crossing inspection sites, seaport inspection sites, military facilities and other security installations. In the case of turnkey security screening solutions, the commencement of screening operations may be dependent on the approval, by a government agency, of the protocols and procedures that our personnel are to follow during the performance of their activities. Sales outside of the United States of our patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental agencies to build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities. Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and our patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes. During these approval periods, we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future revenues that may not occur. If we fail to receive such revenues after expending such resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

CONTENT_14:
The economic slowdown still present in many parts of the world has and could continue to adversely affect our businesses and our profitability. If economic growth continues to remain slow, many customers may continue to delay purchases or reduce purchase quantities. This could result in the reduction in sales of certain of our products, slower adoption of both new technologies and upgrades to existing technologies and could also result in increased price competition. Continued market disruptions and broader economic downturns also increase our exposure to losses from bad debts. If economic or other factors cause financial institutions to fail, we could lose current or potential customers. We cannot predict when the world&#x2019;s economic condition will recover and therefore when this period of delayed and diminished purchasing will end. A prolonged delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
		
		
			Additionally, in August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), committing the U.S. Government to significantly reduce the federal deficit over ten years. The BCA contains provisions commonly referred to as &#x201C;sequestration&#x201D;, which call for substantial, unspecified automatic spending cuts split between defense and non&#8209;defense programs that may continue for a period of ten years. The BCA also included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Likewise, various European governments have implemented or intend to implement austerity measures intended to reduce government spending. Such measures may reduce demand for our products directly by affected governmental agencies and by our customers who derive revenues from these governmental agencies or governmental healthcare programs. We cannot currently predict the impact of governmental spending reductions on us or our customers or whether and to what extent our business and results of operations may be adversely harmed.
		
		
			Further, in June 2015, the Governor of Puerto Rico announced that Puerto Rico could not pay its debts as they were becoming due.  We are currently performing on a 10-year turnkey solutions contract entered into in 2009 with the Ports Authority in Puerto Rico.  If the current fiscal situation in Puerto Rico negatively impacts the ability of the Ports Authority to continue to make payments on our contract, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
		
		
			Any or all of these factors, as well as other consequences of the current economic conditions which cannot currently be anticipated, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.
CONTENT_15:
Certain of our projects require the expenditure of substantial management and financial resources in anticipation of future revenue generation.  For example, in 2012, we entered into a substantial six&#8209;year contract with the Mexican government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various sites throughout Mexico, which required substantial expenditures for capital equipment and infrastructure. Although to date we have generated revenues from this project, if we fail to perform and thus do not receive continued revenues over the remaining life of the project after expending such resources, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate that future contracts for turnkey security screening solutions in other territories could also require the outlay and management of substantial financial resources for capital equipment and infrastructure.
		
		
			Turnkey screening solutions projects, in contrast to the sale and installation of security inspection equipment, also require that we hire and manage large numbers of local personnel in jurisdictions where we may not have previously operated. They also require that we establish, adhere to, adapt and monitor operating procedures over periods that last much longer than our other projects. If we are unable to efficiently manage the adaptation and growth of our operations relating to these projects, our operations could be materially and adversely affected.

CONTENT_16:
We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards and customer needs. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			accurately anticipate customer needs;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			innovate and develop new technologies and applications;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differentiate our offerings from our competitors&#x2019; offerings.
		
			Some of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers&#x2019; products. In developing any new product, we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers&#x2019; needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues.
CONTENT_17:
We purchase raw materials and certain subcomponents from third parties. Standard purchase order terms are as long as one year at fixed costs, but we do not have guaranteed long&#8209;term supply arrangements with our suppliers. In addition, for certain raw materials and subcomponents that we use, there are a limited number of potential suppliers that we have qualified or that we are currently able to qualify. Consequently, some of the key raw materials and subcomponents that we use are currently available to us only from a single vendor. The reliance on a single qualified vendor could result in delays in delivering products or increases in the cost of manufacturing the affected products. Any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
CONTENT_18:
Purchasers of our security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions sometimes require, as a part of our contract, the construction of the facilities that will house our systems and/or operations. Some of these construction projects are significant in size and complexity. We engage qualified construction firms to perform this work. However, if such firms experience delays, if they perform sub&#8209;standard work or if we fail to properly monitor the quality of their work or the timeliness of their progress, we may not be able to complete our construction projects on time. In any such circumstance, we could face the imposition of delay penalties and breach of contract claims by our customer. In addition, we could be forced to incur significant expenses to rectify the problems caused by the construction firm. Any material delay caused by our construction firm subcontractors could therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
CONTENT_19:
We contract with third&#8209;party vendors to service our equipment in the field. We have made such arrangements because sometimes it is more efficient to outsource these activities than it is for our own employees to service our equipment. In addition, some of these vendors maintain stocks of spare parts that are more efficiently accessed in conjunction with a service agreement than would be the case if we were to maintain such spare parts independently. Any material interruption in the ability of our vendors to fulfill such service contracts could adversely affect our ability to fulfill

		customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
CONTENT_20:
Because of long lead times and specialized product designs, in certain cases we purchase components and manufacture products in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts. For a variety of reasons, such as decreased end&#8209;user demand for our products, inadequate or inaccurate forecasts, or other issues that might impact production planning, our customers might not purchase all the products that we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components. In any such event, we would attempt to recoup material and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors, disposing of excess inventory through other channels, or requiring our OEM customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory. However, some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our OEM customers to do this. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs, this could adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and therefore could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
CONTENT_21:
One of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring and investing in businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, working capital and financial resources. We may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			competition among buyers;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the need for regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the high valuations of businesses.
		
			Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire or invest in may be marginally profitable or unprofitable. For these businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and we may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.
		
		
			To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, through either public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms.
CONTENT_22:
We intend to continue to make investments in companies, products and technologies, either through acquisitions, investments or alliances. Acquisition and alliance activities often involve risks, including:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees and realizing synergies expected to result from the acquisition;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in managing product co&#8209;development activities with our alliance partners;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in effectively coordinating sales and marketing efforts;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in combining product offerings and product lines quickly and effectively;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in retaining the key employees of the acquired operation;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			disruption of our ongoing business, including diversion of management time;

				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			inability to successfully integrate the acquired technologies and operations into our businesses and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; 
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			lacking the experience necessary to enter into new product or technology markets successfully; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in integrating financial reporting systems and implementing controls, procedures and policies, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, appropriate for public companies of our size at companies that, prior to the acquisition, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies.
		
			Integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be complex, time consuming and expensive, and can negatively impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The use of debt to fund acquisitions or for other related purposes increases our interest expense and leverage. If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current stockholders percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted. As a result of these and other risks, we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the conduct, operating results or financial condition of our business.
CONTENT_23:
From time to time, our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future. Reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all, and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations.
CONTENT_24:
We have executed a number of significant business and organizational changes to rationalize our overall cost structure. These changes have included and may continue to include the implementation of cost&#8209;cutting measures and the consolidation of facilities. We expect these types of changes may continue from time to time in the future as we uncover additional opportunities to streamline our operations. Successfully managing these changes is critical to our productivity improvement and business success. If we are unable to successfully manage these changes, while continuing to invest in business growth, our financial results could be adversely impacted.
CONTENT_25:
In fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 revenues from shipments made to customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 52%, 61% and 57% of our revenues, respectively. Since we sell certain of our products and services worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenues from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, and therefore employees, suppliers, real property, capital equipment, cash and other assets are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including without limitation:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			changes in a country&#x2019;s or region&#x2019;s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			trade protection measures;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			increased legal risks arising from differing legal systems; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			compliance with export control and anticorruption legislation, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and UK Bribery Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
CONTENT_26:
Our international operations and sales subject us to an international regulatory environment which is becoming increasingly complex and is constantly changing due to factors beyond our control. Risks associated with our international operations and sales include, without limitation, those arising from the following factors:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing legal and court systems and changes to such systems;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing labor laws and changes in those laws;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing tax laws and changes in those laws;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing environmental laws and changes in those laws;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing laws governing our distributors and sales agents and changes in those laws;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing import and export requirements and changes to those requirements; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.
		
			If we fail to comply with applicable international regulatory requirements, even if such non&#8209;compliance by us is inadvertent, or if we are unable to comply with changes to such requirements, our financial performance may be harmed.
CONTENT_27:
We are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. It also requires us to maintain specific record-keeping standards and adequate internal accounting controls. In addition, we are subject to similar requirements in other countries. Bribery, corruption, and trade laws and regulations, and the enforcement thereof, are increasing in frequency, complexity and severity on a global basis. Although we have internal policies and procedures with the intention of assuring compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees, distributors, resellers and contractors involved in our international sales may take actions in violations of such policies. If our internal controls and compliance program do not adequately prevent or deter our employees, distributors, resellers, contractors and/or other third parties with whom we do business from violating anti-bribery, anti-corruption or similar laws and regulations, we may incur severe fines, penalties and reputational damage.
CONTENT_28:
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. export control and customs regulations and customs regulations of other countries. These regulations are complex and vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with such regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation, and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States. Depending on

		severity, any of these penalties could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
CONTENT_29:
We are currently in the process of fulfilling a multi&#8209;year agreement to provide a turnkey security scanning solution to the tax and customs authority of Mexico. This agreement is individually material to our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are certain administrative, legal, governmental and societal risks to operating in Mexico that could adversely impact our operations. Any one or more of the risks that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our agreement and therefore ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations include, without limitation:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			regional political and economic instability;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			high rate of crime in Mexico where we conduct operations;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			ability of key suppliers and subcontractors to fulfill obligations;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			ability to hire and maintain a significant work force;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			burdensome and evolving government regulations;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			cooperation of various departments of the Mexican government in issuing permits, and inspecting our operations on a timely basis;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			providing adequate security among other items;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			receipt of payments in a timely manner;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			termination or change in scope of program and at the election of the government; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			change in the value of the Mexican peso.
CONTENT_30:
Although we perform manufacturing in multiple locations, we generally do not have redundant manufacturing capabilities in place for any particular product or component. As a result, we depend on our current facilities for the continued operation of our business. A natural disaster, epidemic, terrorist act, act of war, or other natural or manmade disaster affecting any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, or delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild, or replace our manufacturing facilities. This delay could be lengthy and we could incur significant expenses to repair or replace the facilities. Any similar natural or manmade disaster that affects a key supplier or customer could lead to a similar disruption in our business.
CONTENT_31:
As we introduce any new and potentially promising product or service, or improve existing products or services with new features or components, companies possessing competing technologies, or other companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights, may be motivated to assert infringement claims in order to generate royalty revenues, delay or diminish potential sales and challenge our right to market such products or services. Even if successful in defending against such claims, patent and other intellectual property related litigation is costly and time consuming. In addition, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation in order to protect our patent or other intellectual property rights, and even if the claims are well&#8209;founded and ultimately successful such litigation is typically costly and time&#8209;consuming and may expose us to counterclaims, including claims for intellectual property infringement, anti&#8209;trust, or other such claims. Third parties could also obtain patents or other intellectual property rights that may require us to either redesign products or, if possible, negotiate licenses from such third parties. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could result in significant liabilities to third parties or injunctions, or could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms, prevent us from manufacturing, importing, distributing, selling or using certain products, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, some licenses

		may be non&#8209;exclusive, which could provide our competitors access to the same technologies. Under any of these circumstances, we may incur significant expenses.
CONTENT_32:
We are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to our current and future success, and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans. The market for skilled employees is highly competitive, especially for employees in technical fields. While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, ultimately, we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans. In addition, we may not be able to continue to attract new employees as required.
CONTENT_33:
All third&#8209;party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the United States or outside, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. These cost&#8209;control methods also potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. In the United States, hospital and other healthcare provider customers, including physicians and ambulatory surgery centers, that purchase our products typically bill various third&#8209;party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures or tests in which our products are used and bill patients for any deductibles or co&#8209;payments. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for our products, any decline in the amount payors are willing to reimburse our customers for the procedures and tests associated with our products could make it difficult for customers to continue using, or adopt, our products and create additional pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business.
		
		
			There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, and some could involve changes that could significantly affect the ways in which doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems and health insurance companies are compensated for the services they provide, which could have a material impact on our business. For example, the Affordable Care Act includes a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. sales of a wide range of medical devices. The excise tax became effective in 2013 and increased our costs. It is not clear at this time whether and to what extent the Affordable Care Act may impact the ability of hospitals and hospital networks to purchase the patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems that we sell or if it will alter market&#8209;based incentives that hospitals and hospital networks currently face to continually improve, upgrade and expand their use of such equipment. While the Affordable Care Act could materially and adversely affect us, at this time we cannot predict the extent of any impact on our business or results of operations.
		
		
			Efforts by governmental and third&#8209;party payors to reduce healthcare costs or the implementation of new legislative reforms imposing additional government controls could cause a reduction in sales or in the selling price of our products, which could adversely affect our business.
CONTENT_34:
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries extensively and rigorously regulate our patient monitoring, cardiology and anesthesia systems, including the research and development, design, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, clearance or approval, safety and efficacy, labeling, advertising, promotion, pricing, recordkeeping, reporting, import and export, post&#8209;approval studies and sale and distribution of these products. In the United States, before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we must first receive either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or approval of a pre-market approval (PMA) application from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is &#x201C;substantially equivalent&#x201D; to a device legally on the market, known as a &#x201C;predicate&#x201D; device, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. To be &#x201C;substantially equivalent,&#x201D; the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or

		effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre&#8209;clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k) process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk.
		
		
			Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval, and some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			we may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA&#x2019;s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the data from our pre&#8209;clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval.
		
			Our future products may not obtain FDA clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Further, the FDA makes periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers and in connection with such inspections issues observations when the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations. If FDA observations are not addressed to the FDA&#x2019;s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, which could include the shutdown of our production facilities, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal penalties. The expense and costs of any corrective actions that we may take, which may include product recalls, correction and removal of products from customer sites and/or changes to our product manufacturing and quality systems, could adversely impact our financial results. Issuance of a warning letter may also lead customers to delay purchasing decisions or cancel orders.
		
		
			In August 2014, the FDA issued a warning letter to our Healthcare division, relating primarily to the maintenance of certain procedures and internal processes at our facility in Snoqualmie, Washington. We have implemented corrective actions as a result of the warning letter and provided the FDA with a detailed response regarding our completed and in process activities. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with our response to the warning letter or our proposed resolution of the outstanding issues. Until the items raised in the warning letter are fully corrected, we may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including the issuance of additional warning letters, injunction, seizure or recall of products, imposition of fines or penalties or operating restrictions on our facilities. Such actions could significantly disrupt our ongoing business and operations and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results.
		
		
			Our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology, anesthesia systems and defibrillator products must also comply with the laws and regulations of foreign countries in which we develop, manufacture and market such products. In general, the extent and complexity of medical device regulation is increasing worldwide. This trend is likely to continue and the cost and time required to obtain marketing clearance in any given country may increase as a result. Our products may not obtain any necessary foreign clearances on a timely basis, or at all.
		
		
			Once any of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology, anesthesia systems or defibrillator products is cleared for sale, regulatory authorities may still limit the use of such product, prevent its sale or manufacture or require a recall or withdrawal of such product from the marketplace. Following initial clearance from regulatory authorities, we continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Government authorities can withdraw marketing clearance or impose sanctions due to our failure to comply with regulatory standards or due to the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance. Ongoing regulatory requirements are wide&#8209;ranging and govern, among other things:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			annual inspections to retain a CE mark for sale of products in the European Union;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			product manufacturing;

CONTENT_35:
We operate in a highly regulated industry. As a result, our business could be adversely affected by governmental actions, including implementation of new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions; changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products; and/or changes in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products. We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize the healthcare industry closely and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may cause increased compliance costs, exposure to litigation and other adverse effects to our operations.

CONTENT_39:
Although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third&#8209;party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third&#8209;party payors for our product, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by federal and state governments, which could significantly impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the federal Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing practices, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing

		remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			federal &#x201C;Sunshine Act&#x201D; requirements imposed by the Affordable Care Act, on device manufacturers regarding any &#x201C;payment or other transfer of value&#x201D; to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#x201C;knowing failures&#x201D;) for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as state anti&#8209;kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third&#8209;party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry&#x2019;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug and device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA/HITECH, thus complicating compliance efforts.
		
			The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
		
		
			Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#x2019;s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental health care programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could impair our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

CONTENT_40:
The healthcare industry has been consolidating and organizations such as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts such as the United States Veterans Administration, continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long&#8209;term contracts. The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing. If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants. Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of products. Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenues and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third&#8209;party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
CONTENT_41:
The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing customer needs, evolving industry or regulatory standards and certifications and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. The emergence of new industry or regulatory standards and certification requirements in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our products. This could happen, for example, if new standards and technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our applications. In addition, any products or processes that we develop may become obsolete or uneconomical before we recover any of the expenses incurred in connection with their development. We cannot provide assurance that we will succeed in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change, new industry standards, changed customer requirements or competitive products on a timely and cost&#8209;effective basis. Additionally, even if we are able to develop new products and product enhancements, we cannot provide assurance that they will be profitable or that they will achieve market acceptance.
		
		
			We develop certain of our security inspection technologies to meet the certification requirements of various agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and the European Civil Aviation Conference among others. Such standards frequently change and there is a risk now and in the future that we may not ultimately be able to develop technologies, or develop in a timely way, solutions that are ultimately able to meet the new standards.
CONTENT_42:
We are subject to various U.S. and international environmental laws, directives, and regulations pertaining to the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances used, and hazardous wastes used or generated, in the manufacture of our products. Such laws mandate the use of controls and practices designed to mitigate the impact of our operations on the environment, and under such laws we may be held liable for the costs associated with the remediation and removal of any unintended or previously unknown releases of hazardous substances on, beneath or from our property and associated operations, including the remediation of hazardous waste disposed off&#8209;site. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of or caused the release of such hazardous substances or wastes. For example, we continue to investigate soil and groundwater contamination at our Hawthorne, California facility that we believe stems from historical releases and off&#8209;site sources. See &#x201C;Business&#x2014;Environmental Regulations&#x201D;. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, or cessation of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

CONTENT_45:
The U.S. Government currently plays an important role in funding the development of certain of our security and inspection systems and sponsoring their deployment at airports, ports, military installations and border crossings. However, in the future, additional research and development funds from the government may not be available to us. If the government fails to continue to sponsor our technologies, we may have to expend more resources on product development or cease development of certain technologies, which could adversely affect our business. Government funded research and development also presents risks associated with government contracting in general that are described elsewhere in our risk factors. Government agencies can generally terminate their contracts for convenience, and if we fail to meet the goals of government funded research and development, there is a risk that the government agency may terminate our contracts for default. In addition, any future grants to our competitors may improve their ability to develop and market competing products and cause our customers to delay purchase decisions, which could harm our ability to market our products.
CONTENT_46:
Certain of our U.S. Government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances.   If we cannot maintain or obtain the required security clearances for our facilities and our employees, or obtain these clearances in a timely manner, we may be unable to perform certain U.S. Government contracts.  Further, loss of a facility clearance, or an employee&#x2019;s failure to obtain or maintain a security clearance, could result in a U.S. Government customer terminating an existing contract or choosing not to renew

		a contract. Lack of required clearances could also impede our ability to bid on or win new U.S. Government contracts. This could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
CONTENT_47:
Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management&#x2019;s attention away from the running of our business. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals, either individually or through class actions, or by governmental entities in investigations and proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in litigation matters, or any other legal proceeding, we may be forced to pay damages or fines and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information about our litigation matters, see &#x201C;Legal Proceedings&#x201D; and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CONTENT_48:
Our credit facility contains a number of significant covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:
		
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			dispose of assets;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			incur certain additional indebtedness;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			repay certain indebtedness;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			create liens on assets;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			pay dividends on our Common Stock;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			make certain investments, loans and advances;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			repurchase or redeem capital stock;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			make certain capital expenditures;
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations; and
		
			
				 &#xB7;
			
		
			
			engage in certain transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates.
		
			These covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, finance our operations, engage in strategic acquisitions or disposals or meet our capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios. Our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.
CONTENT_49:
Our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

		Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.
CONTENT_50:
Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, the current U.S. administration and key members of Congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States, could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. In addition, many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. Certain proposals could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.
CONTENT_51:
We have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions to complement and expand our existing businesses, increase our revenues and profitability, and expand our markets.  As a result of prior acquisitions, we have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet as described in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in charges against earnings, which could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.
CONTENT_52:
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of Preferred Stock, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series and to fix the designation of any such series, without further vote or action by stockholders. The terms of any series of Preferred Stock, which may include economic rights senior to our Common Stock and special voting rights, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Common Stock and thereby reduce the value of our Common Stock. The issuance of Preferred Stock, coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers, could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of our company, including transactions in which the holders of Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices, could otherwise dilute the rights of holders of Common Stock and may limit the ability of such stockholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.
CONTENT_53:
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that, pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the liability of our directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under Delaware law, as that law exists currently and as it may be amended in the future. This is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by us, or in our right for breach of a director&#x2019;s duties to us or our stockholders and may limit the remedies available to us or our stockholders. Under Delaware law, this provision does not apply to eliminate or limit a director&#x2019;s monetary liabilities for: (i) breaches of the director&#x2019;s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violations of law; (iii) the unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) transactions in which the director received an improper personal benefit. Additionally, under Delaware law, this provision does not limit a director&#x2019;s liability for the violation of, or otherwise relieve us or our directors from complying with, federal or state securities laws, nor does it limit the availability of non&#8209;monetary remedies such as injunctive relief or rescission for a violation of federal or state securities laws.
