Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new
products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product
introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company&#146;s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the
availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to
meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and
transitions.

The Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of
whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized
businesses through its online and retail stores.  Carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users&#146; purchases of
the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company&#146;s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.

 Many resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic
conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company&#146;s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company&#146;s products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from
investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company&#146;s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including
staffing selected resellers&#146; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The
financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#146;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#146;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering
and marketing of the Company&#146;s products.

Many of the Company&#146;s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third
parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all.
Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the
Company&#146;s financial condition and operating results.

Given the global nature of its business, the
Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company&#146;s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or
other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.

The Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also
sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#146;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing
arrangements or credit insurance. The Company&#146;s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured
vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with
long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 26, 2015, a significant portion of the Company&#146;s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade
receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor
non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.

The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number
of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company&#146;s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of
earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, in June 2014, the European
Commission opened a formal investigation of Ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company&#146;s Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.
If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, it could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material. 
The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and
governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If
the Company&#146;s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#146;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#146;s financial
condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.
