Even if we revoke the existing waiver to make the NOL Protective Measures operate again to prevent new &#8220;5% shareholders&#8221;, we cannot ensure that an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; will not occur.

&#160;

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code is an extremely complex provision with respect to which there are many uncertainties. Accordingly, if the existing waiver were revoked so that the measures were to operate again to prevent new &#8220;5% shareholders&#8221;, the NOL Protective Measures might not prevent all transfers that might result in an &#8220;ownership change.&#8221;&#160; Alternatively, a court could find that some or all of the NOL Protective Measures are not enforceable, either in general or as to a particular fact situation. Even if the NOL Protective Measures are enforced by state courts, we have not requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) regarding the effectiveness of the NOL Protective Measures, and we cannot ensure that the IRS will agree that the NOL Protective Measures are effective for purposes of Section 382.&#160; Moreover, our Board of Directors could still permit a transfer or transfers that result in or contribute towards an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; if it were to determine that such a transfer is in our best interests.&#160; As a result of these and other factors, the NOL Protective Measures, if operative, would serve to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk that we could undergo an &#8220;ownership change.&#8221; Accordingly, even in such event, we could not assure you that upon audit, the IRS would agree that all of our NOLs are allowable.

&#160;

Our charter documents could deter a takeover effort, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares.

&#160;

The provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prohibit or delay a merger or other takeover of our company, and discourage attempts to acquire us.

&#160;

In addition, if the existing waiver of our NOL Protective Measures were revoked so that the measures operated again to prevent new "5% shareholders", the NOL Protective Measures could be deemed to have an &#8220;anti-takeover&#8221; effect because, among other things, they would restrict the ability of a person, entity or group to accumulate more than 5% of our common stock and the ability of persons, entities or groups now owning more than 5% of our common stock to acquire additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors.&#160; As a result, our Board of Directors might be able to prevent any future takeover attempt. Therefore, the NOL Protective Measures could discourage or prevent accumulations of substantial blocks of shares in which our stockholders might receive a substantial premium above market value and might tend to insulate management against the possibility of removal.

&#160;

The USPS may object to a change of control of our common stock.

&#160;

The USPS may raise national security or similar concerns to prevent foreign persons from acquiring significant ownership of our common stock or of our company. The USPS also has regulations regarding the change of control of approved PC Postage providers.&#160; These concerns may prohibit or delay a merger or other takeover of our company. Our competitors may also seek to have the USPS block the acquisition by a foreign person of our common stock or our company in order to prevent the combined company from becoming a more effective competitor in the market for PC Postage.

&#160;

Our stock price is volatile.

&#160;

The price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:

&#160;




&#183;
variations in our operating results,




&#160;




&#183;
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts,




&#160;




&#183;
investors and the financial community,




&#160;




&#183;
sales by stockholders holding larger blocks of our stock,




&#160;




&#183;
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others, and




&#160;




&#183;
market volatility in general.




&#160;

As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. This type of litigation, if directed at us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources.
