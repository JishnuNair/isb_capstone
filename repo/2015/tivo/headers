We have incurred significant net losses in the past and may never achieve sustained profitability from our non-licensing related operations. We generate a significant amount of revenue from our patent settlement agreements with DISH, AT&T, Verizon, Motorola/Cisco which expire in calendar year 2018 or later, and if we are unable to renew or replace these revenues, our business would be harmed.

HEADER_11:
If we fail to adequately manage our increasingly complex distribution agreements, including licensing, development, and engineering services, we could be subjected to unexpected delays in the deployment of TiVo's advanced television solutions, increased costs, possible penalties and adverse accounting and contractual consequences, including termination of such distribution arrangements. In any such event, our business would be harmed.
HEADER_12:
If we fail to properly estimate, manage, and perform the development and engineering services for our television service provider customers, we could incur additional unexpected expenses and losses which could reduce or even eliminate any profit from these deployment arrangements, in which case our business would be harmed.

Many of our current deployment arrangements with television service providers require us to incur significant upfront development, set-up and integration engineering expenses for which we are in total or in part compensated through future service fees received after a solution is launched.
HEADER_14:
In the event of an early termination of these arrangements with our television service provider customers, we would be forced to recognize any deferred development costs which we have incurred but not recognized without corresponding revenues from development or subscription fees, and in such an event we would be forced to incur unexpected losses.
HEADER_15:
We face risks from the consolidation or change of control of television service providers both in the U.S. and internationally.
