We are also reliant upon U.S. and international suppliers, manufacturing partners and distributors. We are therefore susceptible to adverse U.S. and international economic and market conditions, including the challenging economic conditions that have prevailed and continue to prevail in the U.S. and worldwide. If any of our manufacturing partners, customers, distributors or suppliers experiences serious financial difficulties or ceases operations, our business will be adversely affected. In addition, the adverse impact of the credit crisis on consumers, including higher unemployment rates, is expected to adversely impact consumer spending, which will adversely impact demand for consumer products such as certain end products in which our products are embedded. In addition, prices of certain commodities, including oil, metals, grains and other food products, are volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. High or volatile commodity prices increase the cost of doing business and adversely affect consumers&#8217; discretionary spending. As a result of the difficulty that businesses (including our customers) may have in obtaining credit, the increasing and/or volatile costs of commodities and the decreased consumer spending that is the likely result of the weakness in the general economy, credit market crisis, unemployment and commodities&#8217; price volatility, continued global economic and market turmoil are likely to have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">The trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile due to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, and each of which could adversely affect our stockholders&#8217;

These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company&#8217;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources. Finally, our executive officers, who may hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock, may from time to time, pledge all or a portion of their holdings as collateral or include such holdings in margin accounts.

If we experience inadequate demand or a significant shift in the mix of product orders that makes our existing capacity and capability inadequate, our fixed costs per semiconductor produced will increase, which will harm our financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, if we should experience a sudden increase in demand, we will need to quickly ramp our inventory and/or manufacturing capacity to adequately respond to our customers. If we or our manufacturing partners are unable to ramp our inventory or manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or at all, we risk losing our customers&#8217; business, which could have a negative impact on our financial performance and reputation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If we fail to compete successfully in our highly competitive industry and markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive.

If we are unable to compete successfully in this environment, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be seriously harmed.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If we fail to develop, introduce and sell new products or fail to develop and implement new technologies, our ability to compete in our end markets will suffer and our financial results could be adversely impacted.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Like many semiconductor companies, which operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment marked by rapid obsolescence of existing products, our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that customers choose to buy. Our new products, for example PSoC</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><sup style="vertical-align:top;line-height:120%;font-size:7pt">&#174; </sup></font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">products, BLE, TrueTouch&#8482; and our ETD companies are an important strategic focus for us and therefore, they tend to consume a significant amount of our resources. The new products the market requires tend to be increasingly complex, incorporating more functions and operating at faster speeds than old products. Increasing complexity generally requires smaller features on a chip. This makes manufacturing new generation of products substantially more difficult than prior generations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Despite the significant amount of resources we commit to new products, there can be no guarantee that such products will perform as expected or at all, be introduced on time to meet customer schedules or gain market acceptance. If we fail to introduce new product designs or technologies in a timely manner or are unable to manufacture products according to the requirements of these designs, or if our customers do not successfully introduce new systems or products incorporating our products, or market demand for our new products does not materialize as anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">The complex nature of our manufacturing activities, our broad product portfolio, and our increasing reliance on third-party manufacturers makes us highly susceptible to manufacturing problems and these problems can have a substantial negative impact on us if they occur.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Making semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Even very small impurities in our manufacturing materials, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or other problems in the wafer fabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous chips on each wafer to be non-functional. We and, similarly, our third party foundry partners, may experience problems in achieving an acceptable success rate in the manufacture of wafers and the likelihood of facing such difficulties is higher in connection with the transition to new manufacturing methods. The interruption of wafer fabrication or the failure to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields at any of our facilities, or the facilities of our third-party foundry partners, would seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also experience manufacturing problems in our assembly and test operations and in the introduction of new packaging materials.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We are increasingly dependent upon third parties to manufacture, distribute, generate a significant portion of our product sales, fulfill our customer orders and transport our product. Problems in the performance or availability of these companies could seriously harm our financial performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Although many of our products are fabricated in our manufacturing facilities located in Minnesota and the Philippines, we rely to a significant extent on independent contractors to manufacture and assemble our products. We expect to increase this reliance on third-party manufacturing in the future. In addition, if market demand for our products exceeds our internal manufacturing capacity and available capacity from our foundry partners, we may seek additional foundry manufacturing arrangements.</font></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">18</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;"><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;" href="#sFB69093FB22C3DC05351B76A39334889"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;">Tables of Contents</font></a><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;"><br></font></div></div><br><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">A shortage in foundry manufacturing capacity, which is more likely to occur at times of increasing demand, could hinder our ability to meet demand for our products and therefore adversely affect our operating results. In addition, greater demand for wafers produced by any such foundries without an offsetting increase in foundry capacity raises the likelihood of potential wafer price increases. Our operations would be disrupted if any of our foundry partners terminates its relationship with us or has financial issues and we are unable to arrange a satisfactory alternative to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner. There are also only a few foundry vendors that have the capabilities to manufacture our most advanced products. If we engage alternative sources of supply, we may encounter start-up difficulties, yield issues or incur additional costs. Shipments could be delayed significantly while these sources are qualified for volume production.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">While a high percentage of our products are assembled, packaged and tested at our manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, we rely on independent subcontractors to assemble, package and test the balance of our products. We cannot be certain that these subcontractors will continue to assemble, package and test products for us on acceptable economic and quality terms or at all and it might be difficult for us to find alternatives if they do not do so.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our foundry partners and assembly and test subcontractors have operations in locations that may suffer the impact of certain natural disasters, which could impact their ability to provide us with our products. We monitor these events closely, but if one of our third party manufacturing partners were to suffer significant damage to its operations as a result of a natural disaster, our ability to timely meet consumer demand would suffer which would materially harm our financial results of operation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our channel partners include distributors and resellers. We continue to expand and change our relationships with our distributors. Worldwide sales through our distributors accounted for approximately 69% of our net sales in fiscal year 2014. We rely on many distributors to assist us in creating customer demand, providing technical support and other value-added services to our customers, filling customer orders and stocking our products. We face ongoing business risks due to our reliance on our channel partners to create and maintain customer relationships where we have a limited or no direct relationship. Should our relationships with our channel partners or their effectiveness decline, we face the risk of declining demand which could affect our revenue and results of operations. Our contracts with our distributor may be terminated by either party upon notice. In addition, our distributors are located all over the world and are of various sizes and financial conditions. Any disruptions to our distributors&#8217; operations such as lower sales, lower earnings, debt downgrades, the inability to access capital markets and higher interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We also rely on independent carriers and freight haulers to move our products between manufacturing plants and our customers&#8217; facilities. Transport or delivery problems due to their error or because of unforeseen interruptions in their business due to factors such as strikes, political instability, terrorism, natural disasters or accidents could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and ultimately impact our relationship with our customers.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately and may face significant expenses as a result of ongoing or future litigation.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The protection of our intellectual property rights, as well as those of our subsidiaries, is essential to keeping others from copying the innovations that are critical to our existing and future products. It may be possible for an unauthorized third party to reverse-engineer or decompile our software products. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that, even if patents are issued, they will be respected by third parties. Furthermore, our flexible fab initiative requires us to enter into technology transfer agreements with external partners, providing third party access to our intellectual property and resulting in additional risk. In some cases, these technology transfer and/or license agreements are with foreign companies and subject our intellectual property to foreign countries which may afford less protection and/or result in increased costs to enforce such agreements or intellectual property rights. We anticipate that we will continue to enter into these kinds of licensing arrangements in the future. Consequently, we may become involved in litigation, in the United States or abroad, to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of invalidity. We are also from time to time involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others&#8217; patents or other intellectual property rights.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Moreover, a key element of our strategy is to enter new markets with our products. If we are successful in entering these new markets, we will likely be subject to additional risks of potential infringement claims against us as our technologies are deployed in new applications and face new competitors. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights, particularly in certain international markets, making misappropriation of our intellectual property more likely. Patent litigation, if necessary or if and when instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources.</font></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">19</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;"><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;" href="#sFB69093FB22C3DC05351B76A39334889"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;">Tables of Contents</font></a><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;"><br></font></div></div><br><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Other companies or entities also have commenced, and may again commence, actions seeking to establish the invalidity of our patents. For example, GSI has filed a petition for inter-partes re-examination of two of our patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.  We intend to defend these actions vigorously, but there is no guarantee of success, and such effort takes significant financial and time resources from the Company.  In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court or the USPTO may invalidate the patent(s) or determine that the patent(s) is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If our patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents is limited by a court or USPTO decision, we could be prevented from pursuing certain litigation matters or licensing the invalidated or limited portion of such patents. Such adverse decisions could negatively impact our future, expected revenue.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Intellectual property litigation is frequently expensive to both the winning party and the losing party and could take up significant amounts of management&#8217;s time and attention. In addition, if we lose such a lawsuit, a court could find that our intellectual property rights are invalid, enabling our competitors to use our technology, or require us to pay substantial damages and/or royalties or prohibit us from using essential technologies. For these and other reasons, this type of litigation could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, although in certain instances we may seek to obtain a license under a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us, we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all. We believe we have meritorious defenses and claims in our current litigation and we intend to defend and pursue such claims vigorously. Unfortunately, such litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We also rely on trade secret protection for our technology, in part through confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. Through these and other written agreements, we attempt to control access to and distribution of our intellectual property documentation and other proprietary technology information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, former employees, consultants or third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop a product with the same functionality as our technology. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult, and nearly impossible on a worldwide basis. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property rights, particularly in foreign countries where we do business or where our technology is sold or used, where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States or where the enforcement of such laws is not common or effective.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We face additional problems and uncertainties associated with international operations that could seriously harm us.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">International revenues historically accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues.

Our analyses and forecasts have in the past and, given the complexity and volatility of our business, will likely in the future, prove to be incorrect and could be materially incorrect.

Compliance with these regulations can be costly. We cannot assure you that we have been, or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by the regulators. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible, without regard to fault, for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our or our predecessors&#8217; past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites.

This attention and other factors may lead to changes in environmental regulations that could force us to purchase additional equipment or comply with other potentially costly requirements. If we fail to control the use of, or to adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations, we could face substantial liability or suspension of our manufacturing operations, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the material composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances that apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the European Union (Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC, also known as the &#8220;RoHS Directive&#8221;) and similar legislation in China and California. Other countries, including at the federal and state levels in the United States, are also considering laws and regulations similar to the RoHS Directive. Certain electronic products that we maintain in inventory may be rendered obsolete if they are not in compliance with the RoHS Directive or similar laws and regulations, which could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from those products. Our customers and other companies in the supply chain may require us to certify that our products are RoHS compliant. Although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations, they will likely result in additional costs, or in the worst case decreased revenue, and could even require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products.  Such redesigns result in additional costs and possible delayed or lost revenue.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our worldwide operations could be adversely affected if disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, telecommunication or information technology system failures, regulatory or political issues, power or water shortages, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics or other man-</font></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">21</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"><br></font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:8pt;"><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;" href="#sFB69093FB22C3DC05351B76A39334889"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;font-weight:bold;">Tables of Contents</font></a><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:8pt;"><br></font></div></div><br><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">made disasters or catastrophic events.

Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the Philippines, China and India. We also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. However in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event, our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">System security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and/or harm the reputation of the Company, and any such disruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact our results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential and proprietary information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns.

On October 17, 2013, we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., to reduce the amount of the facility from $430 to $300 million.  The credit facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including a maximum senior secured leverage ratio, a maximum total leverage ratio, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity of at least $100 million. Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations and covenants under our indebtedness depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow.

If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under any indebtedness we owe. As of December&#160;28, 2014, our outstanding debt included $227 million related to our recent credit facility, $10.3 million in capital leases, and $5.9 million in equipment loans.

These requirements will require companies to do diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We have undertaken the necessary diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. However, the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, regardless of our findings, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.

Current and future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or results.  As a result, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not be realized.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We make investments in companies to further our strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments include equity instruments of private companies, and many of these instruments are non-marketable at the time of our initial investment. These companies range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of these companies is dependent on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors as well as their ability to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these companies fail, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for an equity investment in a company in which we have invested, we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">When the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment or business diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. We may incur losses on the disposal of our investments. Additionally, for cases in which we are required under equity method accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company's income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. Gains or losses from equity securities could vary from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities, gains or losses from equity method investments, and impairment charges for equity and other investments.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">There can be no assurance that our cash distributions on common stock will continue to be considered a return of capital.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:10px;text-align:left;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors adopted a policy pursuant to which the Company would pay quarterly cash distributions on our common stock.

Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire, motivate, and retain qualified personnel and our share-based compensation award programs provide us with a competitive compensatory tool for this purpose. The continued use of our share-based compensation program is necessary for us to compete for engineering and other technical personnel and professional talent. In the future, if we are unable to obtain stockholder approval of additional shares for our share-based compensation award programs, we could be at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace for qualified personnel.</font></div>
