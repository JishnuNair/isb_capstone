Construction purchases tend to occur in early spring, and U.S. governmental agencies tend to utilize funds available at the end of the government&#8217;s fiscal year for additional purchases at the end of our third fiscal quarter in September of each year.   Our agricultural equipment business revenues have historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere.  If we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory, which could negatively impact our financial results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Due in part to the buying patterns of our customers, a significant portion of our quarterly revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter, while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable.  A majority of our sales force earns commissions on a quarterly basis which may cause concentrations of orders at the end of any fiscal quarter.  It could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred, orders are not received, or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event such occurrences result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which are based on historical models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.

During 2014 we experienced a strengthening U.S. Dollar which had the impact of making some of our products and services more expensive than many of our local competitors.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In the recent past, uncertainties in the financial and credit markets have caused our customers to postpone purchases, and negative economic conditions may reduce future sales of, or demand for, our products and services.  Negative economic conditions may depress the tax revenues of federal, state and local government entities, which are significant purchasers of our products.  Many of our products are sold through dealer channels, and our dealers depend on the availability of credit to finance purchases of our products for their inventory.  Sources of credit could disappear or the financial situation of our channel partners and customers could become such that they are no longer eligible for such financing. Negative economic conditions may result in increased collection times or greater write-offs, affecting our cash flow. Our suppliers may be impacted by economic pressures, which may adversely affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and therefore cause a disruption in our supply chain.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Financial conditions in several regions continue to place significant economic pressures on existing and potential customers, including our dealer channels.  There is particular concern about economic conditions in Europe, which has experienced negative impacts from sovereign debt levels and government taxing and spending actions to address such issues, and pressures on the banking system in certain European Union countries.  It is uncertain whether central bank or governmental measures will improve these conditions.  Other governments may continue to implement measures which may slow the economic growth rate in those countries (e.g., higher interest rates, reduced bank lending and other anti-inflation measures).  Growth rates in key emerging markets, including China, have slowed, which could affect demand for our products.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We are subject to the cyclicality of the agricultural and engineering and construction industries, which can cause sudden (and sometimes material) declines in demand, with negative effects on sales, inventory levels and product pricing.  In general, demand in the engineering and construction industries for our products is highly correlated to the economic cycle and can be subject to even greater levels of volatility.  The agricultural spending cycle is influenced by general economic conditions as well as weather, crop loads, commodity pricing, especially corn, the availability of credit and the strength of the U.S. Dollar.  In 2014, the agricultural sector experienced a significant downturn which is continuing, which had a negative effect on the company&#8217;s overall growth rate.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">If there is significant deterioration in the global economy, the economies of key countries or regions, or important customer markets, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.  Changes in economic conditions also make it difficult to make financial forecasts, which could cause us to miss our financial guidance and adversely affect our stock price.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which can adversely affect our operating results</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Fluctuations in currencies impact our operating results, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. A significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., and as such, we face exposure to movements in non-U.S. currency exchange rates.  These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.  During 2014 our business was negatively impacted by the strong U.S. Dollar which increased the cost of some of our products and services relative to those of local competitors in some jurisdictions.  If the U.S. Dollar remains strong or there is an increase in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, it could negatively impact foreign demand for our products or reduce the dollar value of local currency sales.  Possible import, export, tariff, and other trade barriers, which could be imposed by other countries, might have a material adverse effect on the business.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Currently, we routinely hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.  The hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the short term impact of currency fluctuations on certain non-functional currency assets and liabilities.  Our attempts to hedge against these risks could be unsuccessful and expose us to losses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Investing in and integrating new acquisitions could be costly, place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and may fail to deliver the expected return on investment, which could negatively impact our operating results </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We typically acquire a number of companies each year, and intend to continue to acquire other companies.

The testing of this goodwill and intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines requires significant use of judgment and assumptions.  Changes in business conditions could require negative adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in write-offs which adversely affect our results.  If we divest a business and the proceeds are less than the net book value at the time, we would be forced to write off the difference.

Our failure to form and maintain such alliances, or the pre-emption of such alliances by actions of competitors, will adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers.  Our relationships with substantial industry participants such as Caterpillar and CNH are complex and multifaceted, and may be subject to change based upon the business needs and objectives of the parties.

Changes in our product mix, including increasing provision of software and bundled solutions tailored to the needs of specific vertical markets, impose new demands on our distribution channels and may require significant changes in the skills and expertise required to successfully distribute our products and services, or the creation of new distribution channels.  Recruiting and retaining qualified channel partners and training them in the use and the selling of our technology and product offerings requires significant time and resources.  In order to develop and expand our distribution channels, we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel, including our investment in systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.  The time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings, including our new&#160;product developments, and newer types of offering such as software and services, may make it more difficult to introduce those products to end-users and delay end-user adoption, which could result in lower revenues.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Disruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic markets could cause difficulties in marketing, selling or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.

As a result, an increasing amount of our business involves business models which require managerial techniques and skill sets which are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses.  We are increasingly selling products and solutions directly to large enterprise customers and other end users of our products.  A direct sales model requires different skills and management processes and procedures from those we have generally used in our business in the past, and may create conflicts with our channel partners.  An increasing portion of our business will be associated with professional services in order to customize our solutions for the needs of individual customers, which has not previously represented a significant portion of our business.   If we are not successful in executing on these new models, our sales and revenue may suffer.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Changes in our software and subscription businesses may negatively affect our operating results     </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">An increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period, which typically range from one to five years.  Our customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including overall economic conditions, the health of their businesses, competitive offerings and customer dissatisfaction with our services.  If customers do not renew their contracts for our products, our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer.  Any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell, even if our customer acquisition rates do not change, will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue growth.  Since its introduction, our software as a service delivery model has also contributed to subscription revenue.  If any of our assumptions about expenses, revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect, or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, and our financial results will be negatively impacted.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We continually re-evaluate our software licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions. Changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs, including the timing of the release of enhancements, upgrades, maintenance releases, the term of the contract, discounts, promotions and other factors, could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  We may implement different licensing models which require the Company to recognize licensing fees over a longer period.  Over the last few years, we have increasingly offered additional products in a software as a service (SAAS) model.  SAAS revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period.  Any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model, could increase the amount of revenue to be recognized over time as opposed to upfront, which would delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results in any quarterly period.  Due to these complexities associated with revenue recognition, we may not be able to accurately forecast our non-deferred and deferred revenues, which could cause us to miss our earnings estimates or revenue projections and negatively impact our stock price.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We face substantial competition in our markets which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our markets are highly competitive and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future.  Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality and performance of our products, the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force,  the level of customer service, the development of new technology and our ability to participate in emerging markets.  Within each of our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical and laser suppliers and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors and new market entrants, particularly from emerging markets such as China.  Our products, which commonly use GNSS for basic location information, may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping </font></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">19</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><a name="s32913E418920EEC8F1A61BB23A82CE80"></a><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;" href="#s1984F9F814445E35D3651BB23A00AC9E"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><br><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">technology</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;">.  </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As we sell an increasing amount of software and subscription services, we face competition from a group of large well established companies with whom we have not previously competed.  Our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past.  These developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices and new computing platforms.  Such competition has in the past resulted and in the future may result in price reductions, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition.  We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products.  We may not be able to implement this strategy successfully, and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other resources than we do.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We are dependent on new products and services and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market, or to effectively compete with new, disruptive product alternatives, our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis.  We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance of such products and services.  We may incur problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services.  Our development stage products may not be successfully completed or, if developed, may not achieve significant customer acceptance.  Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and we might not achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.  The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.  If we are unable to introduce new products and services, if other companies develop competing technology products and services, or if we do not develop compelling new products and services, our number of customers may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, which could harm our operating results. Many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services.  The software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences which require us to address multiple delivery platforms, new mobile devices and cloud computing.  Life cycles of software products can be short and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products.  The introduction of third-party solutions embodying new, disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or non-competitive.  If we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, or if we are unable to adapt to new technologies or new industry standards that impact our markets, our ability to retain or increase market share and revenues could be materially adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Some of our products rely on third party technologies including open source software, so if integration or incompatibility issues arise with these technologies or these technologies become unavailable, our product and services development may be delayed, our reputation could be harmed and our business could be adversely affected</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We license software, technologies and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties.  The third party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors, resulting in development delays.  Some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors.  In many cases, if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements, the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately.  The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance, any such third party software or technology could result in increased costs, or delays in software releases or updates, until such issues have been resolved.  This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We also incorporate open source software into our products.  Although we monitor our use of open source, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products.  In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third-parties in order to continue offering our products, to disclose and offer royalty-free licenses in connection with our own source code, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We are dependent on proprietary technology, which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology, and we rely on patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright law to protect our intellectual property.  The patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated, circumvented, infringed and challenged.  The rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us.  Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.</font></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">20</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><a name="s32913E418920EEC8F1A61BB23A82CE80"></a><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;" href="#s1984F9F814445E35D3651BB23A00AC9E"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><br><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology or design around the patents owned by us.  In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries.  The steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings.  Third-parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.  For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers.  The number of these claims has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future.  As new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents, it may be necessary for us to withdraw products from the market, secure a license from such patent holders, or redesign our products.  In addition, the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations.  Any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources, including the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which harm our results of operations and financial condition.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Our global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of operations may be adversely affected&#160;by our efforts to comply with U.S. laws which apply to international operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and US export control laws, as well as the laws of other countries</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We operate on a global basis with offices or activities in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, Australasia and North America.  We face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations.  These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export control laws, and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers.  Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export license in connection with sales outside the United States.  Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise.  Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that U.S. law and regulations prohibit us from using.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:</font></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="font-family:Times New Roman;

Although purchase orders placed with Flextronics are cancelable, the terms of the agreement would require us to purchase from Flextronics all inventory not returnable or usable by other Flextronics customers.  Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity from Flextronics to meet customers&#8217; delivery requirements or we may accumulate excess inventories, if such inventories are not usable by other Flextronics customers.  Our current contract with Flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We rely on specific suppliers for a number of our critical components and on other contract manufacturers, including Benchmark Electronics and Jabil, for the manufacture, test and assembly of certain products and components.  We have experienced shortages of components in the past.  Our current reliance on specific or a limited group of suppliers and contract manufacturers involves risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules, discontinuation of certain components, and economic conditions which may adversely impact the viability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers.  This situation may be exacerbated during any period of economic recovery or a competitive environment.  Any inability to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture, assemble and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum and our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our GNSS technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands.  International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.  These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:8px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Any ITU or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our customers, both of which could reduce demand for our products.  For example, the FCC has been considering proposals to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations throughout the United States.  If the FCC were to permit implementation of such proposals, or similar proposals, terrestrial broadband wireless operations could create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers.  Similarly, other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products.  </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Many of our products use other radio frequency bands, such as the public land mobile radio bands, together with the GNSS signal, to provide enhanced GNSS capabilities, such as real-time kinematics precision.  The continuing availability of these non-GNSS radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced GNSS products to our precision survey, agriculture, and construction machine controls markets.  In addition, transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in-band may impair the utility and reliability of our products.  Any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Many of our products rely on GNSS technology, GPS and other satellite systems, which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">GNSS technology, GPS satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption.  Many of the GPS satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.  However, of the current deployment of 30 operational satellites in orbit, five have been in operation for more than 15 years, and over half have been in use for more than 7.5 years.  Repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.  If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.  A reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24-satellite standard established for GPS may impair the utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.  In addition, software updates to GPS satellites and ground control segments can cause problems, and we depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of such updates to mitigate these problems.  </font></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">22</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><a name="s32913E418920EEC8F1A61BB23A82CE80"></a><div><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:9pt;"><a style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;" href="#s1984F9F814445E35D3651BB23A00AC9E"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:9pt;">Table of Contents</font></a></div></div><br><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As the principal GNSS currently in operation, we are dependent on continued operation of GPS.  The GPS constellation is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS.  If supporting policies were to change, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Many of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System and National Differential GPS System, and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our RTX corrections services.  Some of these augmentation systems are operated by the U.S. government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems.  Any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to, or use of the signals, or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance, with an adverse effect on our business.   </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Many of our products use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS System.  Other countries, including China and India, are in the process of creating their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use GNSS signals from these systems.  The European community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as Galileo.  National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position.  If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, this could result in lost revenue.  These authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their GNSS systems, to the detriment of Trimble products using the US GPS system, which would harm our business.   </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We are subject to the impact of governmental and other similar certifications processes and regulations which could adversely affect our products and our business</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We market certain products that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.  For example, CE certification for radiated emissions is required for most GNSS receiver and data communications products sold in the European community.  In the future, U.S. governmental authorities may propose GPS receiver testing and certification for compliance with published GPS signal interface or other specifications.  An inability to obtain any such certifications in a timely manner could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  Governmental authorities may also propose other forms of GPS receiver performance standards, which may limit design alternatives, hamper product innovation or impose additional costs.  Some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end-user to obtain licensing from the FCC for frequency-band usage.  These are secondary licenses that are subject to certain restrictions.  An inability or delay in obtaining such certifications or changes to the rules by the FCC could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market which could harm our customer relationships and therefore, our operating results.  Any failure to obtain the requisite certifications could also harm our operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.  Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.  Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.  Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.  A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and other bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles.  For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  This standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.  The standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  Early adoption is not permitted.  We are currently in the process of assessing the adoption methodology, which allows the amendment to be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.  We are also evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not determined whether the effect will be material.  Adoption of this standard, along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.  Any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.

The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on December 1 and June 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2015.  When the Notes mature, we will have to expend significant resources to repay these Notes or seek to refinance them.  If we decide to refinance the Notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the Notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">On November 24, 2014, we entered into a new five-year credit agreement with a group of lenders (the 2014 Credit Facility).  The 2014 Credit Facility provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility of $1.0 billion and a letter of credit sub-facility of up to $50.0 million.  Subject to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility, the revolving loan facility may be increased and term loan facilities may be established in an amount of up to $500.0 million.  Upon entering into the 2014 Credit Facility, we borrowed $307.0 million under this revolving loan facility.  We also have two $75 million revolving credit facilities which are uncommitted and may be called by the lenders with very little notice (the Uncommitted Facilities).  At the end of fiscal 2014, our total debt was comprised primarily of Notes of $400.0 million, a revolving loan balance of $277.0 million under the 2014 Credit Facility and a revolving credit line balance of $57.0 million under the Uncommitted Facilities.

The goal of the rule is to cut direct and indirect funding of groups engaged in armed conflict and human rights abuses.  We are committed to compliance with the SEC's Conflict Minerals Rule and support its intended objective.  This new rule requires us to: (1) determine whether conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold or similar derivatives) are used in our products and, if so, determine if the minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or its immediately adjoining countries; and (2), if so, conduct due diligence regarding the source and chain of custody of these conflict minerals to determine whether the conflict minerals financed or benefitted armed groups.  The rule required us to submit forms and reports to the SEC by May 31, 2014 and annually thereafter that disclose our determinations and due diligence measures.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Trimble does not directly purchase any conflicts minerals.  Tracing these materials back to their country of origin is a complex task that may require us to, among other things, survey suppliers in our supply chain to understand what programs they have in place for tracing the source of minerals supplied to us or used in products supplied to us and to ensure that reasonable due diligence has been performed.  Presently, we have not determined how many or if any of our supply chain partners use conflict minerals.  In addition to the increased administrative expense required to comply with the new requirements that apply to us, we may face a limited pool of suppliers who can provide us &#8220;conflict-free&#8221; components, parts and manufactured products, and we may not be able to obtain conflict-free products or supplies in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices for our operations, and may be required to disclose that our products are not &#8220;conflict free.&#8221;  This could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation and may harm its relationships with business partners and customers, and our stock price could suffer as a result.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:14pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:14pt;"><br></font></div>
