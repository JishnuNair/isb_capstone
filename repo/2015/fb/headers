HEADER_3:
If we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and business may be significantly harmed.
HEADER_4:
We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers with Facebook, could seriously harm our business.

HEADER_10:
We prioritize user growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results. 
HEADER_11:
If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our business and financial results may be harmed.

Our costs are continuing to grow, which could harm our business and profitability.
HEADER_17:
Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.
HEADER_18:
We have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business.
HEADER_19:
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.
HEADER_20:
We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
HEADER_21:
We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
HEADER_22:
We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products.
HEADER_23:
Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock.
HEADER_24:
We plan to continue to make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.
HEADER_25:
We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.
HEADER_26:
If our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
HEADER_27:
Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.
HEADER_28:
We could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.
HEADER_29:
Our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.
HEADER_30:
Certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.

We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.

HEADER_35:
Payment transactions on Facebook may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

HEADER_42:
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock
HEADER_43:
The trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.
HEADER_44:
We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
HEADER_45:
The dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.
HEADER_46:
We have elected to take advantage of the "controlled company" exemption to the corporate governance rules for NASDAQ-listed companies, which could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.
HEADER_47:
Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.
