We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of
December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013. Our failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial
statements, our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could in turn cause the trading price of our common stock
to decline.  </I></B></FONT></P>

these material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement of our historical financial statements, they did result in adjustments to the accounting for business

response to the identified material weaknesses, our management, with oversight from our audit committee, has dedicated significant resources and efforts to improve our control

We cannot predict the outcome of our assessment and that of our independent registered public accounting firm in future periods. If we do not successfully remediate these material weaknesses and
conclude in future periods that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations on a timely basis, our financial statements may
contain material misstatements, our operating results may be negatively impacted, and we may be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and
potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. </FONT></P>

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to report
accurately our financial results or prevent material fraud. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the
trading price of our ordinary shares.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent material fraud. We have
in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on,
and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. We have an ongoing program to perform
the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur significant expenses and to devote significant management
resources to Section&nbsp;404 compliance. In the event that our CEO, CFO or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not
effective as defined under Section&nbsp;404, investor perceptions of our company may be adversely affected and may cause a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, future
non-compliance with Section&nbsp;404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension or delisting of our ordinary shares from The NASDAQ Global Select Market,
which could reduce our share price. </FONT></P>

downturns characterized by decreases in product demand and excess customer inventories. Economic volatility can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and vendors to accurately
forecast and plan future business activities. This unpredictability could cause our customers to reduce spending on our products and services, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore,
during challenging economic times our customers and vendors may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could affect their ability to make timely payments to us. As a result, we
may experience growth patterns that are different than the end demand for products, particularly during periods of high volatility. </FONT></P>

gross margins and other financial metrics. Any downturn in the semiconductor industry may be severe and prolonged, and any failure of the industry to fully recover from downturns could seriously
impact our revenue and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

We may pursue acquisitions of other companies or new or complementary products, technologies and

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may pursue acquisitions of other companies or new or complementary products, technologies and businesses in the future. Acquisitions
create additional, material risk factors for our business that could cause our results to differ materially and adversely from our expected or projected results. Such risk factors include the effects
of possible disruption to the continued expansion of our product lines, potential changes in our customer base and changes to the total available market for our products, reduced demand for our
products, the impact of any such acquisition on our financial results, negative customer reaction to any such acquisition and our ability to successfully integrate an acquired company's operations
with our operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions
present a number of other potential risks and challenges that could disrupt our business operations. For example, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the
acquisition on favorable terms. If an acquired company also has inventory that we assume, we will be required to write up the carrying value of that inventory to its fair value. When that inventory is
sold, the gross margins for those products are reduced and our gross margins for that period are negatively affected. Furthermore, the purchase price of any acquired businesses may exceed the current
fair values of the net tangible assets of such acquired businesses. As a result, we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill, acquired in-process research and development and other
intangible assets, which could result in significant impairment and acquired in-process research and development charges and amortization expense in future periods. These charges, in addition to the
results of operations of such acquired businesses and potential restructuring costs associated with an acquisition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. We cannot forecast the number, timing or size of future acquisitions, or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operating or financial results. Furthermore,
potential acquisitions, whether or not consummated, will divert our management's attention and may require considerable cash outlays at the expense of our existing operations. In addition, to complete
future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our
profitability. </FONT></P>

InfiniBand may not be adopted at the rate or extent that we anticipate, and adoption of InfiniBand
is largely dependent on third-party vendors and end users.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the usage of InfiniBand has increased since its first specifications were completed in October 2000, continued adoption of
InfiniBand is dependent on continued collaboration and cooperation among IT vendors. In addition, the end users that purchase IT products and services from vendors must find InfiniBand to be a
compelling solution to their IT system requirements. We cannot control third-party participation in the development of InfiniBand as an industry standard technology. We rely on server, storage,
communications infrastructure equipment and embedded systems vendors to incorporate and deploy InfiniBand ICs in their systems. InfiniBand may fail to effectively compete with other technologies,
which may be adopted by vendors and their customers in place of InfiniBand. The adoption of InfiniBand is also affected by the general replacement cycle of IT equipment by end users, which is
dependent on factors unrelated to InfiniBand. These factors may reduce the rate at which InfiniBand is incorporated by our current server vendor customers and impede its adoption in the storage,
communications infrastructure and embedded systems markets, which in turn would harm our ability to sell our InfiniBand products. </FONT></P>

We have limited visibility into customer and end-user demand for our products and generally have
short inventory cycles, which introduce uncertainty into our revenue and production forecasts and business planning and could negatively impact our financial results.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. In addition, our customers may defer
purchase orders. We place orders with the manufacturers of our products according to our estimates of customer demand. This process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions with
respect to both our customers' and end users' demands. It is more difficult for us to accurately forecast end-user demand because we do not sell our products directly to end users. In addition, the
majority of our adapter card business is conducted on a short order fulfillment basis, introducing more uncertainty into our forecasts. Because of the lead time associated with fabrication of our
semiconductors, forecasts of demand for our products must be made in advance of customer orders. In addition, we base business decisions regarding our growth on our forecasts for customer demand. As
we grow, anticipating customer demand may become increasingly difficult. If we overestimate customer demand, we may purchase products from our manufacturers that we may not be able to sell and may
over-budget our operations. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we would forego revenue opportunities and could lose market share
or damage our customer relationships. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the majority of our revenues are derived from customer orders received and fulfilled in the same quarterly period. If we overestimate customer demand, we could miss our
quarterly revenue targets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. </FONT></P>

We depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of any
one of these customers will adversely affect our revenues.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, sales to
Hewlett-Packard, Dell and IBM accounted for 11%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues, while sales to our top ten customers accounted for 62% of our revenues. For the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2013, sales to IBM and Hewlett-Packard accounted for 17% and 13%, respectively, of our total revenues, while sales to our top ten customers accounted for 67% of our revenues.
Because the majority of servers, storage, communications infrastructure equipment and embedded systems are sold by a relatively small number of vendors, we expect that we will continue to depend on a
small number of customers to account for a
significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our customers, including our most significant customers, are not obligated by long-term contracts to purchase our products and may
cancel orders with limited potential penalties. If any of our large customers reduces or cancels its purchases from us for any reason, it could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of
operations. </FONT></P>

We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce our
market share, net revenues and profit margin.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The markets in which we operate are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change, continuously evolving
customer requirements and fluctuating average selling prices. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or potential competitors. With respect to InfiniBand products, we compete with
Intel Corporation. For Ethernet technology, the leading IC vendors include Emulex, Intel and Broadcom Corporation. The leading IC vendors that provide Ethernet and Fibre Channel products to the market
include Marvell Technology Group, Emulex Corporation and QLogic Corporation. The leading Ethernet switch system vendors include Cisco, Brocade, Juniper and Arista. In HPC, EDC, Web 2.0, cloud and
financial services markets, products based on the InfiniBand standard primarily compete with the industry-standard Ethernet and Fibre Channel interconnect technologies. In embedded markets, we
typically compete with interconnect technologies that are developed in-house by system OEM vendors and created for specific applications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
of our customers are also IC and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting
such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them.
Consequently, these customers may become competitors to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. In the past, we have lost design wins to divisions within our
customers and this may occur again in the future. We cannot predict whether these customers will continue to compete with us, whether they will continue to be our customers or whether they will
continue to buy products from us at the same volumes. Competition could increase pressure on us to lower our prices and could negatively affect our profit margins. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater economies of scale, stronger name recognition and larger customer
bases than we have. This may allow them to respond more quickly than we are able to respond to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. In addition, these competitors may have
greater credibility with our existing and potential customers. If we do not compete successfully, our market share, revenues and profit margin may decline, and, as a result, our business may be
adversely affected. </FONT></P>

We rely on a limited number of subcontractors to manufacture, assemble, package and production test
our products, and the failure of any of these third-party subcontractors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and
limit our growth.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we design and market our products and conduct test development in-house, we do not manufacture, assemble, package and production
test our products, and we must rely on third-party subcontractors to perform these services. We use TSMC to manufacture and ASE to assemble, package and production test our IC products. We use
Flextronics International&nbsp;Ltd., Sanmina-SCI Corporation, A.L Electronics Engineering, Production Services&nbsp;Ltd and USI to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and
switch systems. In addition, we also use Comtel Electronics to manufacture some of our switch systems. We use several sub-contractors to manufacture our cables. If these subcontractors do not provide
us with high-quality products, services and production and production test capacity in a timely manner, or if one or more of these
subcontractors terminates its relationship with us, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis, our relationships with our customers could
suffer, our sales could decrease and our growth could be limited. In particular, there are significant challenges associated with moving our IC production from our existing manufacturer to another
manufacturer with whom we do not have a pre-existing relationship. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, the consolidation of foundry subcontractors, as well as the increasing capital intensity and complexity associated with fabrication in smaller process geometries has limited
our diversity of suppliers and increased our risk of a "single point of failure." Specifically, as we move to smaller geometries, we have become increasingly reliant on IC manufacturers. The lack of
diversity of suppliers could also drive increased prices and adversely affect our results of operations, including our product gross margins </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
currently do not have long-term supply contracts with any of our third-party subcontractors. Therefore, they are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any
specific period, in any specific quantities or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. None of our third-party subcontractors has provided contractual
assurances to us that adequate capacity will be available to us to meet future demand for our products. Our subcontractors may allocate capacity to the production of other companies' products while
reducing deliveries to us on </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success and ability to compete in the future may depend to a significant degree upon obtaining sufficient patent protection for our
proprietary technology. Patents that we currently own do not cover all of the products that we presently sell. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if they result in
issued patents, the patents may not have claims of the scope we seek. Even in the event that these patents are not issued, the applications may become publicly available and proprietary information
disclosed in the applications will become available to others. In addition the lives of acquired patents may also be of shorter term depending upon their acquisition dates and the issue dates. In
addition, any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or declared unenforceable. The term of any issued patent in the United States and Israel would be 20&nbsp;years from its filing date, and
if our applications are pending for a long time period, we may have a correspondingly shorter term for any patent that may be issued. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection
for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages to us. For example, competitors could be successful in challenging any issued patents or, alternatively, could develop
similar or more advantageous technologies on their own or design around our patents. Also, patent protection in certain foreign countries may not be available or may be limited in scope and any
patents obtained may not be as readily enforceable as in the United States and Israel, making it difficult for us to effectively protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other
companies in these countries. Our inability to obtain and enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection,
we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later on turn out to be important. </FONT></P>

Intellectual property litigation, which is common in our industry, could be costly, harm our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time
to time, we receive notices from competitors and other third parties that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused other parties' proprietary rights. We may also be required to
indemnify some customers and strategic partners under our agreements if a third party alleges or if a court finds that our products or activities have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused
another party's proprietary rights. We have received requests from certain customers and strategic partners to include increasingly broad indemnification provisions in our agreements with them.
Additionally, our products may contain technology provided to us by other parties such as contractors, suppliers or customers. We may have little or no ability to determine in advance whether such
technology infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party. Our contractors, suppliers and licensors may not be required to indemnify us in the event that a claim of infringement is
asserted against us, or they may be required to indemnify us only up to a maximum amount, above which we would be responsible for any further costs or damages. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions
of infringement in the markets we serve involve highly technical and subjective analyses. We are involved in intellectual property litigation today and litigation may be
necessary in the future to enforce any patents we may receive and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of
others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, and we may not prevail in any such future litigation. Litigation, whether or not determined in our favor or settled, could be costly,
could harm our reputation and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations. In addition, adverse determinations in litigation could
result in the loss of our proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, and require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from licensing our technology or selling our
products, any of which could seriously harm our business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the normal course of business, we enter into agreements and terms and conditions that require us to indemnify the other party against third-party claims alleging that one of our
products infringes or misappropriates intellectual property rights, as well as against certain claims relating to property damage, personal injury or acts or omissions relating to supplied products or
technologies, or acts or omissions made by us or our employees, agents or representatives. In addition, we are obligated pursuant to indemnification undertakings with our officers and directors to
indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by law and to indemnify venture capital funds that were affiliated with or represented by such officers or directors. If we receive demands for
indemnification under these agreements and terms and conditions, they will likely be very expensive to settle or defend, and we may incur substantial legal fees in connection with any indemnity
demands. Our indemnification obligations
under these agreements and terms and conditions may be unlimited in duration and amount, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our
income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are subject to income taxes in Israel, the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax could be
adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, by discovery of new information in
the course of our tax return preparation process, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, the tax rate due on dividends, interest and capital gains
applicable to individuals will be increased as well. Our effective income tax rates are also affected by intercompany transactions for sales, services, funding and other items. Given the increased
global scope of our operations, and the complexity of global tax and transfer
pricing rules and regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction. If actual earnings within a tax jurisdiction differ materially from our
estimates, we may not achieve our expected effective tax rate. Additionally, our effective tax rate may be affected by the tax effects of acquisitions, restructuring activities, newly enacted tax
legislation, share-based compensation and uncertain tax positions. Finally, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities which
may result in the assessment of additional income taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income
taxes. However, unanticipated outcomes from these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. </FONT></P>

formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed

Regional instability in Israel may adversely affect business conditions and may disrupt our

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations located in Israel. A significant number of our employees and
material amount of assets are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in
1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, as well as incidents of civil unrest. These conflicts negatively affected business conditions in Israel. In
addition, Israel and companies doing business with Israel have, in the past, been the subject of an economic boycott. In addition, there has been recent civil unrest in certain areas in the Middle
East, including Egypt, Syria and Libya. Any future armed conflicts or political instability in the region may negatively affect business conditions and adversely affect our results of operations.
Parties with whom we do business have sometimes declined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary. In addition,
the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments
under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in the agreements. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
can give no assurance that security and political conditions will have no impact on our business in the future. Hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of
trade between Israel and its present trading partners could adversely affect our operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. Our Israeli operations, which are located in
northern Israel, are within range of Hezbollah missiles and we or our immediate surroundings may sustain damages in a missile attack, which could adversely affect our operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, our business insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government
currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or
damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. </FONT></P>

business, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws in China. In addition, the anti-corruption laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may,
in some cases, conflict with each other. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and other policies prohibit us and our employees from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for
the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and from engaging in unethical business practices, including kick-backs to or from purely private parties. However, there can be no assurance that all of
our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of such laws and our related anti-corruption policies and procedures. Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our
business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
principal research and development facilities are located in Israel, and our directors, executive officers and other key employees are located primarily in Israel and the United
States. In addition, we engage sales representatives in various countries throughout the world to market and sell our products in those countries and surrounding regions. If we encounter any of the
above risks in our international operations, we could experience slower than expected revenue growth and our business could be harmed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are incorporated in Israel. Three of our executive officers and three of our directors, one of whom is also an executive officer,
are non-residents of the United States and are located in Israel, and a significant amount of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. Two of our executive
officers and five of our directors are located in the United States. Therefore, it may be difficult to enforce a judgment obtained in the United States against us or any of the above persons in
Israel. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, it may be difficult for a shareholder to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to
hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S.
law must be proved in an Israeli court as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Israeli Companies Law generally requires that a merger be approved by the board of directors and by the general meeting of the
shareholders. Upon the request of any creditor of a merging company, a court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there is a reasonable concern that, as a result of the merger, the
surviving company will be unable to satisfy its obligations. In addition, a merger may generally not be completed unless at least (i)&nbsp;50&nbsp;days have passed since the filing of the merger
proposal with the Israeli Registrar of Companies and (ii)&nbsp;30&nbsp;days have passed since the merger was approved by the shareholders of each of the merging companies. </FONT></P>

Exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the NIS may negatively affect our earnings.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all of our revenues and a majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our research and
development expenses and our Israeli facility expenses are incurred in new Israeli shekels ("NIS"). As a result, we are exposed to risk to the extent that the inflation rate in Israel exceeds the rate
of devaluation of the NIS in relation to the U.S. dollar, or if the timing of these devaluations lags behind inflation in Israel. In that event, the U.S. dollar cost of our research and development
operations in Israel will increase and our U.S. dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. To the extent that the value of the NIS increases against the U.S. dollar, our
expenses on a U.S. dollar cost basis increase. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation in Israel or the rate of appreciation of the NIS against the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar
cost of our research and development operations and facility expenses in Israel increases, our dollar-measured results of operations will be adversely affected. Our operations also could be adversely
affected if we are unable to guard against currency fluctuations in the future. Further, because all of our international revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a strengthening of the dollar versus
other currencies could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and the collection of our receivables more difficult. To help manage this risk we have been engaged in foreign currency
hedging activities. These measures, however, may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in Israel and changes in value of NIS against the U.S. dollar. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our operations in Israel have been granted "Approved Enterprise" and "Beneficiary Enterprise" status by the Investment Center
in the Israeli Ministry of Economy (formerly the Ministry of Industry Trade and Labor) and the Israeli Income Tax Authority, which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the Israeli Law for
Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959. The availability of these tax benefits is subject to certain requirements, including, among other things, making specified investments in fixed assets and
equipment, financing a percentage of those investments with our capital contributions, complying with our marketing program which was submitted to the Investment Center, filing of certain reports with
the Investment Center, limiting manufacturing outside of Israel and complying with Israeli intellectual property laws. If we do not meet these requirements in the future, these tax benefits may be
cancelled and we could be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received plus interest and penalties thereon. The tax benefits that our current "Approved Enterprise" and
"Beneficiary Enterprise" program receives may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all. If these tax benefits were reduced or eliminated, the amount of taxes that we pay would

distributed. The tax rate will be the rate which would have been applicable had we not been granted the beneficial status . This rate is generally between 10% and the corporate tax rate in Israel,
depending on the percentage of our shares held by foreign shareholders. The dividend recipient is subject to withholding tax at the source at the reduced rate applicable to dividends from Approved
Enterprises, which is 15% if the dividend is distributed during the tax exemption period (subject to the applicable double tax treaty) or within 12&nbsp;years after the period. This 12&nbsp;year

The Israeli government grants that we received require us to meet several conditions and restrict

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received grants from the government of Israel through the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel's Ministry of Economy (the
"OCS"), for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures in Israel. When know-how is developed using or in connection with OCS grants, the Encouragement of Industrial
Research and Development Law 5744-1984, or the R&amp;D Law, as well as the regulations, the OCS guidelines and the terms of these grants restrict the transfer of the know-how outside of Israel. Transfer
of know-how outside of Israel requires pre-approval by the OCS which may at its sole discretion grant such approval and impose certain conditions, and is subject to the payment of a transfer fee
calculated according to the formula provided in the R&amp;D Law which takes into account, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>inter alia</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, the consideration for such know-how paid to us in the
transaction in which the technology is transferred. In general, transfer fees are no less than the funding received plus interest less the royalties already paid for the transferred know-how. In
addition, any decrease of the percentage of manufacturing performed in Israel, as originally declared in the application to the OCS, requires us to obtain the approval of the OCS and may result in
increased amounts to be paid to the OCS or tax authorities. These restrictions may impair our ability to enter into agreements for those products or technologies without the approval of the OCS or tax
authorities. We cannot be certain that any approval of the OCS or tax authorities will be obtained on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, in the event that we undertake a
transaction involving the transfer to a non-Israeli entity of technology developed with OCS funding pursuant to a merger or similar transaction, the consideration available to our shareholders may be
reduced by the amounts we are required to pay to the OCS. Any approval, if given, will generally be subject to additional financial obligations. If we fail to comply with the conditions imposed by the
OCS or tax authorities, we may be required to refund any payments previously received, together with interest and penalties as well as tax
benefits. Also, failure to meet the restrictions concerning transfer of know-how outside of Israel may trigger criminal liability. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
Israeli tax law treats some acquisitions, particularly share-for-share swaps between an Israeli company and a foreign company, less favorably than U.S. tax law. Israeli tax
law generally provides that a shareholder who exchanges our shares for shares in a foreign corporation is treated as if the shareholder has sold the shares. In such a case, the shareholder will
generally be subject to Israeli taxation on any capital gains from the sale of shares (after two years, with respect to one half of the shares, and after four years, with respect to the balance of the
shares, in each case unless the shareholder sells such shares at an earlier date), unless a relevant tax treaty between Israel and the country of the shareholder's residence exempts the shareholder
from Israeli tax. Please see "Risk Factors&#151;Provisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or make difficult an acquisition of our company, which could prevent a change of control and
therefore depress the price of our shares." for a further discussion of Israeli laws relating to mergers and acquisitions. These provisions in our amended and restated articles of association and
other provisions of Israeli law could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares. </FONT></P>

We may incur increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies, including Israeli laws, rules adopted by the SEC and by The NASDAQ
Stock Market, may result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements. These laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of
insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar
coverage. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive
officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements.  </FONT></P>
