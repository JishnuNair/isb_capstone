ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
HEADER_2:
The risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in other filings by us with the SEC, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that are not currently believed by us to be material may also harm our business operations and financial results. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Risks Related to Our Business
HEADER_4:
We operate under and pay royalties pursuant to statutory and third-party licenses for the reproduction and public performance of sound recordings that could change or cease to exist, which would adversely affect our business. 
HEADER_5:
We depend upon third-party licenses for the right to publicly perform musical works and a change to these licenses could materially increase our content acquisition costs.
HEADER_6:
Changes in third-party licenses for the right to publicly perform musical works may reduce the sound recordings that we perform on the service or materially increase our content acquisition costs.
HEADER_7:
Our inability to obtain accurate and comprehensive information to identify the ownership of a musical work may impact our ability to remove musical works or decrease the number of performances of a particular musical work, subjecting us to potential copyright infringement and difficulties in controlling content acquisition costs.
HEADER_8:
Internet radio is an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.
HEADER_9:
Advertising on mobile devices, such as smartphones, is an emerging phenomenon, and if we are unable to increase revenue from our advertising products delivered to mobile devices, our results of operations will be materially adversely affected.
HEADER_10:
Advertising spending is increasingly being placed through new data-driven channels, such as the programmatic buying ecosystem, where mobile offerings are not as mature as their web-based equivalents. Because a large percentage of listeners use our service via mobile devices, our growth prospects and revenue may be adversely impacted if the advertising ecosystem is slow to adopt data-driven mobile advertising offerings.
HEADER_11:
Emerging industry trends in digital advertising measurement and pricing may pose challenges for our ability to forecast and optimize our advertising inventory which may adversely impact our advertising revenue.
HEADER_12:
We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to be profitable.
HEADER_13:
Our failure to convince advertisers of the benefits of our service in the future could harm our business.
HEADER_14:

HEADER_19:
We face, and will continue to face, competition with other content providers for advertising spending.
HEADER_20:
Our ability to increase the number of our listeners will depend in part on our ability to establish and maintain relationships with automakers, automotive suppliers and consumer electronics manufacturers with products that integrate our service.
HEADER_21:
If we are unable to continue to make our technology compatible with the technologies of third-party distribution partners who make our service available to our listeners through mobile devices, consumer electronic products and automobiles, we may not remain competitive and our business may fail to grow or decline.
HEADER_22:
Unavailability of, or fluctuations in, third-party measurements of our audience may adversely affect our ability to grow advertising revenue.
HEADER_23:
The lack of accurate cross-platform measurements for internet radio and broadcast radio may adversely affect our ability to grow advertising revenue.
HEADER_24:
Our success depends upon the continued acceptance of online advertising as an alternative or supplement to offline advertising.
HEADER_25:
Assertions by third parties of violations under state law with respect to the public performance and reproduction of pre-1972 sound recordings could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.
HEADER_26:
Our royalty payments are subject to audits and certain royalty calculation methods involve significant judgment.
HEADER_27:
Expansion of our operations into non-music content, including our launch of comedy, subjects us to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks.
HEADER_28:
Loss of agreements with the makers of mobile operating systems and devices, renegotiation of such agreements on less favorable terms, or other actions these third parties may take could harm our business.
HEADER_29:

If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.
HEADER_31:
Our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brand and failure to maintain and enhance our brand would harm our ability to expand our base of listeners, advertisers and other partners.
HEADER_32:
We depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.
HEADER_33:
Interruptions or delays in service arising from our own systems or from our third-party vendors could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business.
HEADER_34:
Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.
HEADER_35:
Failure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.
HEADER_36:
Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violation by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.

Federal, state and industry regulations as well as self-regulation related to privacy and data security concerns pose the threat of lawsuits and other liability, require us to expend significant resources, and may hinder our ability and our advertisers' ability to deliver relevant advertising. 
HEADER_44:
If our security systems are breached, we may face civil liability and public perception of our security measures could be diminished, either of which would negatively affect our ability to attract and retain listeners and advertisers.
HEADER_45:
We are subject to a number of risks related to credit card and debit card payments we accept.
HEADER_46:
If we fail to detect click fraud or other invalid clicks on ads, we could lose the confidence of our advertisers, which would cause our business to suffer.

Some of our services and technologies may use "open source" software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our service or require that we release the source code of certain services subject to those licenses.
HEADER_48:
Government regulation of the internet is evolving, and unfavorable developments could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
