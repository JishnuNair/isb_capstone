ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS
HEADER_2:
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.
HEADER_3:
Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.
HEADER_4:
Our gross margin may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and may be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.
HEADER_5:
Aggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business.
HEADER_6:
Our ability to increase our revenue will depend upon continued growth of demand by consumers and businesses for additional network capacity.
HEADER_7:
Any delays in the development and introduction of our products or in releasing enhancements to our existing products may harm our business.
HEADER_8:
The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively.
HEADER_9:
Our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that result in decreased revenue due to lower average selling prices and potentially higher cost of sales leading to lower gross margin, all of which would harm our operating results.
HEADER_10:
We must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.
HEADER_11:
We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, and if we fail to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will not meet our customers’ product delivery requirements. 
HEADER_12:
If we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may increase our operating costs, decrease our revenue and harm our business.
HEADER_13:
If our contract manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our business may be harmed.
HEADER_14:
We are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results.
HEADER_15:
If we fail to expand sales of our products into the metro market, our ability to increase revenue will be harmed.
HEADER_16:
Our manufacturing process is very complex and the partial or complete loss of our manufacturing facility, or a reduction in yields or an inability to scale capacity to meet customer demands could harm our business.
HEADER_17:
If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights.
HEADER_18:
Claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our business.
HEADER_19:
Unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and gross margin.
HEADER_20:
Product performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation.
HEADER_21:
If we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed, our business may be harmed. 
HEADER_22:
Our debt obligations may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and will be a burden on our future cash flows and cash resources, particularly if these obligations are settled in cash upon maturity or sooner upon an event of default.
HEADER_23:
We may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of the Notes, and thereby dilute our existing stockholders and potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
HEADER_24:
The make-whole fundamental change provisions of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.
HEADER_25:
If we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
HEADER_26:
Our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter. 
HEADER_27:
Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results. 
HEADER_28:
We may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
HEADER_29:
If we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.
HEADER_30:
Any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operations.
HEADER_31:
Unforeseen health, safety and environmental costs could harm our business.
HEADER_32:
We are subject to governmental regulations that could adversely affect our business.
HEADER_33:
Natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations.
HEADER_34:
Security incidents, such as data breaches and cyber-attacks, could compromise our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.
HEADER_35:
The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.
HEADER_36:
Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.
