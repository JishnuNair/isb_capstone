HEADER_4:
the following risks could materially adversely affect our business operations,
HEADER_5:
results of operations and financial condition and could result in a significant
HEADER_6:
decline in our stock price.
HEADER_7:
Before deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described in this section. This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
HEADER_8:
and accompanying notes thereto, and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
HEADER_9:
We expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.
HEADER_10:
Our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.
HEADER_11:
If we fail to continue to introduce or acquire new products that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively and we will be unable to increase or maintain net revenue and gross margins.
HEADER_12:
If we fail to overcome the challenges associated with managing our broadband service provider sales channel, our net revenue and gross profit will be negatively impacted.
HEADER_13:
We rely on a limited number of retailers, wholesale distributors and service provider customers for a substantial portion of our sales, and our net revenue could decline if they refuse to pay our requested prices or reduce their level of purchases or if there is significant consolidation in our customer base which results in fewer customers for our products.
HEADER_14:
We depend on large, recurring purchases from certain significant customers, and a loss, cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively affect our revenue.
HEADER_15:
Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share.
HEADER_16:
If we do not effectively manage our sales channel inventory and product mix, we may incur costs associated with excess inventory, or lose sales from having too few products.
HEADER_17:
Our business is subject to the risks of international operations. 
HEADER_18:
We obtain several key components from limited or sole sources, and if these sources fail to satisfy our supply requirements or we are unable to properly manage our supply requirements with our third party manufacturers, we may lose sales and experience increased component costs.
HEADER_19:
If we lose the services of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick C.S. Lo, or our other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.
HEADER_20:
If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.
HEADER_21:
As part of growing our business, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute or integrate our acquisitions, then our business and operating results could be harmed and our stock price could decline. 
HEADER_22:
The average selling prices of our products typically decrease rapidly over the sales cycle of the product, which may negatively affect our net revenue and gross margins.
HEADER_23:
We depend substantially on our sales channels, and our failure to maintain and expand our sales channels would result in lower sales and reduced net revenue.
HEADER_24:
Changes in tax rates, adverse changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our future profitability.
HEADER_25:
We must comply with indirect tax laws in multiple foreign jurisdictions. Audits of our compliance with these rules may result in additional liabilities for tax, interest and penalties related to our international operations which would reduce our profitability.
HEADER_26:
We are exposed to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations in jurisdictions where we transact in local currency, which could harm our financial results and cash flows.
HEADER_27:
Economic conditions are likely to materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
HEADER_28:
System security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our internal operations or information technology or networking services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. 
HEADER_29:
We have been and will be investing increased additional in-house resources on software research and development, which could disrupt our ongoing business and present distinct risks from our historically hardware-centric business.
HEADER_30:
We are subject to, and must remain in compliance with, numerous laws and governmental regulations concerning the manufacturing, use, distribution and sale of our products, as well as any such future laws and regulations. Some of our customers also require that we comply with their own unique requirements relating to these matters. Any failure to comply with such laws, regulations and requirements, and any associated unanticipated costs, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
HEADER_31:
We depend on a limited number of third-party manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing needs. If these third-party manufacturers experience any delay, disruption or quality control problems in their operations, we could lose market share and our brand may suffer.
HEADER_32:
We are currently involved in numerous litigation matters and may in the future become involved in additional litigation, including litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly and subject us to significant liability.
HEADER_33:
We are required to evaluate our internal controls under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation, including restatements of our issued financial statements, could impact investor confidence in the reliability of our internal controls over financial reporting.
HEADER_34:
The marketability of our AirCard products may suffer if wireless telecommunications operators do not deliver acceptable wireless services. 
HEADER_35:
If our products contain defects or errors, we could incur significant unexpected expenses, experience product returns and lost sales, experience product recalls, suffer damage to our brand and reputation, and be subject to product liability or other claims.

If we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be harmed.
HEADER_42:
