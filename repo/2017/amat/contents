As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers&#8217; capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied&#8217;s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied&#8217;s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations.To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied&#8217;s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.

Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied&#8217;s revenues, results of operations and financial condition.  Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied&#8217;s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied&#8217;s ability to compete effectively.Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied&#8217;s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied&#8217;s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations.&#160;If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied&#8217;s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.14Table of Contents

The largest proportion of Applied&#8217;s consolidated net sales and profitability is derived from sales of manufacturing equipment in the Semiconductor Systems segment to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied&#8217;s semiconductor equipment and service products, including:&#8226;the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied&#8217;s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;&#8226;the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including shrinking geometries, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;&#8226;the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;&#8226;the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;&#8226;the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller geometries to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;&#8226;challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers&#8217; levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied&#8217;s products have lower relative market presence;&#8226;the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;15Table of Contents&#8226;semiconductor manufacturer&#8217;s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;&#8226;shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;&#8226;competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;&#8226;consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;&#8226;shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied&#8217;s foundry customers;&#8226;the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied&#8217;s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; &#8226;investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China; and&#8226;the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.

The global display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs, and on demand for advanced smartphones and mobile device displays, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and the profitability of Applied&#8217;s display products, including:&#8226;the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;&#8226;the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied&#8217;s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;&#8226;the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China;&#8226;the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;&#8226;the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied&#8217;s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and&#8226;the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied&#8217;s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.16Table of Contents

Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, and its future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products, and its ability to increase its position in its current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in a geographically diverse and competitive environment, and that may require greater collaboration with customers and other industry participants, have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and lower profits. To compete successfully, Applied must:&#8226;identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;&#8226;develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;&#8226;differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers&#8217; performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;&#8226;maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;&#8226;enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;&#8226;focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers&#8217; high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;&#8226;effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;&#8226;improve the productivity of capital invested in R&amp;D activities;&#8226;accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;&#8226;improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;&#8226;adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;&#8226;qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and &#8226;implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.

Applied&#8217;s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation.  Applied&#8217;s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied&#8217;s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied&#8217;s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied&#8217;s net sales, gross margins and net income.  Applied&#8217;s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition.  The concentration of Applied&#8217;s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied&#8217;s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied&#8217;s business, revenue and gross margins. 17Table of Contents

Applied has product development, engineering, manufacturing, sales and other operations distributed throughout many countries, and some of its business activities are concentrated in certain geographic areas. Moreover, in fiscal 2017, approximately 90 percent&#32;of Applied&#8217;s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. As a result of the global nature of its operations, Applied&#8217;s business performance and results of operations may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:&#8226;uncertain global economic and political business conditions and demands;&#8226;political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;&#8226;customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;&#8226;variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations, including contract, intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws, and the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;&#8226;global trade issues, including the ability to obtain required import and export licenses, trade sanctions, tariffs, and international trade disputes;&#8226;ineffective or inadequate legal protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries;&#8226;positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;&#8226;fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;&#8226;geographically diverse operations and projects, and our ability to maintain appropriate business processes, procedures and internal controls, and comply with environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption and other regulatory requirements;&#8226;supply chain interruptions, and service interruptions from utilities, transportation, data hosting or telecommunications providers;&#8226;a diverse workforce with different experience levels, languages, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations, and differing employment practices and labor issues;&#8226;variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;&#8226;fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S.&#160;dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel, Chinese yuan or Singapore dollar;&#8226;the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;&#8226;performance of third party providers of outsourced functions, including certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, information technology and other activities;&#8226;political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;&#8226;challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;&#8226;the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and&#8226;uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied&#8217;s business. 18Table of Contents

Applied&#8217;s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied&#8217;s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied&#8217;s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied&#8217;s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied&#8217;s intellectual property.Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied&#8217;s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied&#8217;s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied&#8217;s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied&#8217;s business and results of operations.&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied&#8217;s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied&#8217;s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.

Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied&#8217;s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied&#8217;s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied&#8217;s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.
CONTENT_19:
Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied&#8217;s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates; (3) plans to indefinitely reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; and (4) valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. An increase in Applied&#8217;s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. As of October&#160;29, 2017, Applied intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $4.5 billion&#32;of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries and does not plan to repatriate these funds.  Applied would need to accrue and pay U.S. taxes if these funds were repatriated. Income tax legislation in the U.S., the &#8220;Tax Cuts and Jobs Act&#8221;, could possibly be enacted during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which could impact Applied&#8217;s provision for income taxes, effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition. &#160;For example, under&#160;legislative proposals requiring mandatory repatriation that are being considered, Applied would need to accrue U.S. taxes on previously unrepatriated earnings. Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied&#8217;s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied&#8217;s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.
CONTENT_20:
Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; handling, discharge, recycling and disposal of hazardous materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in: significant remediation or other legal liabilities; the imposition of penalties and fines; restrictions on the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products;&#160;limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and&#160;a decrease in the value of its real property. Applied could be required to alter its manufacturing and operations and incur substantial expense in order to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations could subject Applied to significant costs and liabilities that could adversely affect Applied&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.23Table of Contents

As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied&#8217;s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied&#8217;s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.&#160;<div
