We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers properly.
HEADER_12:
Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
HEADER_13:

HEADER_14:
Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
HEADER_15:
Integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. Any failure by us to integrate acquired companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
HEADER_16:
We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our restructuring may adversely affect our business.
HEADER_17:
Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.
HEADER_18:
Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.
HEADER_19:
Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in the IT industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.
HEADER_20:
The allocation of intellectual property rights that was made between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. as part of the separation of the two entities, and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the Separation, could in the future adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.
HEADER_21:
Failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
HEADER_22:
We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.
HEADER_23:
Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.
HEADER_24:
In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.
HEADER_25:
System security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.
HEADER_26:
Terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.
HEADER_27:
Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.
HEADER_28:
Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.

HEADER_32:
Risks Related to the Separations of our Former Enterprise Services Business and our Former Software Segment
HEADER_33:
The stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC or Micro Focus (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us.
HEADER_34:
Risks Related to the Prior Separation from Former Parent
HEADER_35:
If the distribution, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and those who received Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock in the distribution could be subject to significant tax liabilities, and, in certain circumstances, Hewlett Packard Enterprise could be required to indemnify HP Inc. for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.
HEADER_36:
Our historical financial information for periods prior to the Separation is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.
HEADER_37:
The Separation and Distribution Agreement that we entered into with our former Parent may limit our ability to compete in certain markets and may impose limitations on our recruiting efforts for a period of time following the Separation.
HEADER_38:
Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. may fail to perform under the transition services agreement and other transaction agreements executed as part of the Separation, and we may not have necessary systems and services in place when these transaction agreements expire.
HEADER_39:
Indemnification liabilities to HP Inc. pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
HEADER_40:
In connection with the Separation, HP Inc. has indemnified us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that HP Inc.'s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.
HEADER_41:
We are subject to continuing contingent liabilities as a result of our separation from our former Parent.
HEADER_42:
