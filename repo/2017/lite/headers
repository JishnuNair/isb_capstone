ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
HEADER_2:
Investors in our securities should carefully consider all of the relevant factors disclosed by us, including the following factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition or stock price. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to our business, risks related to the Separation and risks related to our common stock.
HEADER_3:
Risks Related to Our Business
HEADER_4:
Changing technology and intense competition require us to continuously innovate while controlling product costs, and our failure to do so may result in decreased revenues and profitability.
HEADER_5:
Continued competition in our markets may lead to an accelerated reduction in our prices, revenues and market share.
HEADER_6:
The manufacturing of our products may be adversely affected if our contract manufacturers and suppliers fail to meet our production requirements or if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities.
HEADER_7:
We depend on a limited number of suppliers for raw materials, packages and components, and any failure or delay by these suppliers in meeting our requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
HEADER_8:
We rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales; and the majority of our customers do not have contractual purchase commitments.
HEADER_9:
We contract with a number of large OEM and end-user service providers that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.
HEADER_10:
Our products may contain defects that could cause us to incur significant costs, divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers.
HEADER_11:
We expect to change our international corporate structure in the near future in order to minimize our effective tax rate; however, if we are unable to adopt this structure or if it is challenged by U.S. or foreign tax authorities, we may be unable to realize such tax savings which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.
HEADER_12:
We are subject to risks arising from our international operations, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
HEADER_13:
Our operating results may be subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency.
HEADER_14:
Our ability to develop, market, and sell products could be harmed if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel.

HEADER_20:
If we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect our rights, our business would be materially harmed.
HEADER_21:
Our products may be subject to claims that they infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the resolution of which may be time-consuming and expensive, as well as require a significant amount of resources to prosecute, defend, or make our products non-infringing.
HEADER_22:
We face certain litigation risks that could harm our business.
HEADER_23:
Our products incorporate and rely upon licensed third-party technology, and if licenses of third-party technology do not continue to be available to us or are not available on terms acceptable to us, our revenues and ability to develop and introduce new products could be adversely affected.
HEADER_24:
We are subject to laws and other regulations worldwide including with respect to environmental matters, securities laws, privacy and personal data collection compliance with which could increase our expenses and harm our operating results.

HEADER_26:
Our revenues, operating results, and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, which makes predicting financial results difficult.
HEADER_27:
Risks Related to the Separation and Our Operation as an Independent Public Company
HEADER_28:
Potential indemnification liabilities to Viavi pursuant to the Separation agreement could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
HEADER_29:
In connection with the Separation, Viavi has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Viavi’s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation will not be impaired in the future.
HEADER_30:
We have characterized Viavi’s contribution of the CCOP segment and WaveReady product lines to us as a taxable transaction.  If tax authorities were to take the position that this contribution is not a taxable transaction, then we may face greater than expected income tax liabilities, which would negatively impact our operating results.
HEADER_31:
We could have an indemnification obligation to Viavi if the distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition treatment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
HEADER_32:
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.

Certain provisions in our charter and Delaware corporate law could hinder a takeover attempt.

HEADER_40:
Transactions relating to our 2024 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.
