We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
HEADER_14:
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock
HEADER_29:
The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile.
