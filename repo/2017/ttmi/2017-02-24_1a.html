In some cases, employers have responded by significantly increasing the wages of workers at such plants. Any increase in labor costs due to minimum wage laws or customer requirements about scheduling and overtime that we are unable to recover in our
pricing to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the high turnover rate and our difficulty in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and the other labor

year. As a result of our acquisition of Viasystems, the NOLs acquired were subject to this limitation. In November 2016, 13,800,000 shares of common stock were sold by Su Sih, our largest shareholder and a

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Under its current leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies, including the encouragement of foreign
trade and investment and greater economic decentralization. No assurance can be given, however, that the government of China will continue to pursue such policies, that such policies will be successful if pursued, or that such policies will not be
significantly altered from time to time. Despite progress in developing its legal system, China does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws, particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade.
Enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain, and implementation and interpretation thereof may be inconsistent. As the Chinese legal system develops, the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws, and the preemption
of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors. Further, any litigation in China may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management&#146;s attention. In addition, though
changes in government policies and rules are timely published or communicated, there is usually no indication of the duration of any grace period before which full implementation and compliance will be required. As a result, we may operate our
business in violation of new rules and policies before full compliance can be achieved. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT

the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the government&#146;s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks, such as contractor suspension or
debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">For the year ended January&nbsp;2, 2017,
aerospace and defense sales accounted for approximately 15% of our total net sales. The substantial majority of aerospace and defense sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs. While we do not sell any significant
volume of products directly to the U.S. government, we are a supplier to the U.S. government and its agencies, as well as foreign governments and agencies. Consequently, our sales are affected by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and
foreign governments and may be affected by federal budget sequestration measures. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The domestic and international threat of

success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated, and qualified managerial and professional personnel. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or
attract additional qualified management in the future. We can make no assurances that future changes in executive management will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our business also
depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified employees, particularly engineering and sales and marketing personnel. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these employees could harm our
business. Further, our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies depends in part on our ability to retain key management and existing employees at the time of the acquisition. </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes. We rely on the collective experience of our employees
involved in our manufacturing processes to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies in our industry. Although we are not dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees, if a significant number of our employees
involved in our manufacturing processes were to leave our employment, and we were not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable experience, our manufacturing processes might suffer as we might be unable to keep up with
innovations in the industry. As a result, we may lose our ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, we have experienced a significant amount of employee attrition in our China operations each year, which has negatively impacted our
yield, costs of production, and service times. </FONT></P>

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other measures to protect our proprietary information. All of these
measures afford only limited protection. These measures may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged, and others may develop technologies or processes that are similar or superior to our technology. We may not have the controls and procedures in
place that are needed to adequately protect proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Furthermore, there is a risk that we
may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. As is the case with many other companies in the PCB industry, we from time to time receive communications from third parties asserting patent rights to our products and enter into
discussions with such third parties. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur costs in either defending or settling any intellectual property disputes alleging infringement. If any claims are brought
against the customers for such infringement, whether or not these have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defending such claims. In the event we are subject to any infringement claims, we may be required to spend a
significant amount of money to develop <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-infringing</FONT> alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or in obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all,
which could disrupt the production processes, damage our reputation, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT

public or private offerings. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without action by stockholders, to designate and issue preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may also
designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each series of preferred stock, any or all of which may be superior to the rights of the common stock. Any such issuance of additional shares would reduce your influence over matters on which our
stockholders vote, would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at a time when we would otherwise be
able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. Any issuances of preferred stock would likely result in your interest being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock. Also, we may have shareholders that hold
large quantities of our shares. If one or more of these shareholders offered their shares for sale, it could result in a decrease in demand for our shares which could have the effect of decreasing our share price. The market price of our common
stock could decline as a result of any future offering as well as sales of shares of our common stock made after such offerings or the perception that such sales could occur. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%"><FONT

any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, legal
requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our debt agreements and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Consequently, shareholders should not rely
on dividends in order to receive a return on your investment. See our dividend policy in Item 5. <I>Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities</I>. </FONT></P>
