Our operations and financial performance are dependent on the global economy.  Uncertainty regarding future economic conditions makes it challenging both in the near and long-term to forecast operating results, make business decisions, and identify risks that may affect our business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition, and results of operations.  Economic concerns, such as uncertain or inconsistent global or regional economic growth, stagnation or contraction, including the pace of economic growth in the United States in comparison to other geographic and economic regions, pressure on economic growth in Europe, uncertain growth prospects in the Asia Pacific region, as well as anxiety regarding geopolitical conflicts and their short and long-term economic impact, increase the uncertainty and unpredictability for our business as consumers, businesses and governmental agencies periodically and often unpredictably postpone or forego spending.  A global economic downturn or erratic or declining business or governmental spending or hiring may reduce sales of our products, increase sales cycles, slow adoption of new technologies, increase price competition, and cause customers and suppliers to default on their financial obligations.Additionally, to the extent governments implement austerity measures in response to economic conditions, demand for our products by governmental agencies subject to the measures and by customers who derive all or a portion of their revenues from these agencies may decline.  Similarly, to the extent uncertainty regarding public debt limits or governmental budgets, particularly in the U.S and Europe, hinder spending by retail consumers, businesses or governmental agencies, sales of our products may be materially harmed or delayed.Additionally, our customers suffer from their own financial and economic challenges.  If global or regional economic conditions deteriorate, whether in general or in specific market segments, one or more customers may demand pricing accommodations, delay payments or become insolvent. It is impossible to reliably determine if and to what extent customers may suffer, whether we will be required to adjust our prices or face collection issues with customers or if customer bankruptcies will occur.

Given the nature of the markets in which we compete, our revenues and profitability vary from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict for many reasons, including the following:&#8226;variations in the volume and timing of orders received during each quarter;&#8226;shifts in product, geographic or channel mix;&#8226;the timing of customers' sales promotions and campaigns;&#8226;the timing of large customer deployments, including UC infrastructure; &#8226;the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors and obsolescence or discontinuance of existing products;&#8226;competition, including pricing pressure, promotions and campaigns by us, our competitors or our customers; &#8226;failure to timely introduce new products within projected costs; &#8226;changes in technology and desired product features, including whether those changes occur in anticipated manners and timeframes;&#8226;general economic conditions in the U.S. and our international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations;&#8226;seasonality, including related to our retail channels during the holiday season; &#8226;customer cancellations and rescheduling;&#8226;fluctuations in raw materials and components costs; and&#8226;investments in and the costs associated with new product development and strategic initiatives.Fluctuations in our operating results, including the failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of financial analysts, may cause volatility, including material decreases, in the trading price of our common stock.&#32;9Table of Contents

Our Enterprise products represent our largest source of revenue, and we regard the market for headsets designed for UC as our greatest long-term opportunity in the Enterprise market.  We believe the implementation of UC technologies by large enterprises will be a significant long-term driver of UC headset adoption, and, as a result, a key long-term driver of our revenue and profit growth.  Accordingly, we continue to invest in the development of new products and enhance existing products to be more appealing in functionality and design for the UC office market; however, there is no guarantee significant UC growth will occur, when it might occur, or that we will successfully take advantage of it if it does occur.Our ability to realize and achieve positive financial results from Enterprise product sales, and UC sales in particular, could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:&#8226;As UC becomes more widely adopted, competitors may offer solutions that effectively commoditize our headsets, which, in turn, may pressure us to reduce the prices of one or more of our products.&#8226;The market success of major platform providers and strategic partners such as Microsoft Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Avaya, Inc., Alcatel-Lucent, and Huawei, and our influence over such providers with respect to the functionality of their platforms and product offerings, their rate of deployment, and their willingness to integrate their platforms and product offerings with our solutions, is limited.  For example, Microsoft&#8217;s decision to transition from Lync to Skype for Business in early Fiscal Year 2016 proved to be a more significant market transition than anticipated and caused end customers to pause their deployment schemes or schedules while they assessed the implications of Microsoft&#8217;s decision.&#8226;Failure to timely introduce solutions that are cost effective, feature-rich, stable, and attractive to customers within forecasted development budgets.&#8226;Failure to successfully implement and execute new and different processes involving the design, development, and manufacturing of complex electronic systems composed of hardware, firmware, and software that works seamlessly and continuously in a wide variety of environments and with multiple devices.&#8226;Failure of UC solutions generally, or our solutions in particular, to be adopted with the breadth and speed we anticipate.  For example, concerns about data privacy and the security of information and data stored over the Internet and wireless security in general, each of which is further enabled by UC solutions, including our products, have caused entities in various markets to reassess data protection compliance and security safeguards of our devices.&#8226;Failure of our sales model and expertise to support complex integration of hardware and software with UC infrastructure consistent with changing customer expectations.&#8226;Increased competition for market share, particularly given that some competitors have superior technical and economic resources enabling them to take greater advantage of market opportunities.&#8226;Sales cycles for more complex UC deployments are longer as compared to our traditional Enterprise products.&#8226;Our inability to timely and cost-effectively adapt to changes and future business requirements may impact our profitability in this market and our overall margins.&#8226;Failure to expand our technical support capabilities to support the complex and proprietary platforms in which our products are and will be integrated as well as increases in our support expenditures over time.If our investments in, and strategic focus on, Enterprise products and UC products, in particular, do not generate incremental revenue, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Our industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short-term customer commitments, and changes in demand.  Production levels are forecasted based on anticipated and historic product demand and we often place orders with suppliers for materials, components and sub-assemblies (&#8220;materials and components&#8221;) as well as finished products 13 weeks or more in advance of projected customer orders.  Actual customer demand depends on many factors and may vary significantly from forecasts.  We will lose opportunities to increase revenues and profits and may incur increased costs and penalties including expedited shipping fees and late delivery penalties if we underestimate customer demand.Conversely, overestimating demand could result in higher inventories of materials and components and finished products, which may later require us to write off all or a material portion of our inventories.  We routinely review inventory for usage potential, including fulfillment of customer warranty obligations and spare part requirements, and we write down to the lower of cost or market value the excess and obsolete inventory, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.&#32;10Table of ContentsFor instance, periodically, we or our competitors announce new products, capabilities, or technologies that replace or shorten the life cycles of legacy products or cause customers to defer or stop purchasing legacy products until new products become available.  Additionally, new product announcements may incite customers to increase purchases of successful legacy products as part of a last-time buy strategy, thereby increasing sales in the short-term while decreasing future sales and delaying new product adoption.  These risks increase the difficulty of accurately forecasting demand for discontinued and new products as well as the likelihood of inventory obsolescence, loss of revenue and associated gross profit.If any of the above occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.
CONTENT_6:
Our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials and components as well as finished products of acceptable quality at acceptable prices.  We buy materials and components from a variety of suppliers and assemble them into finished products.  In addition, certain of our products and key portions of our products lines are manufactured for us by third party original design and contract manufacturers ("ODMs") who obtain materials and sub-components from long and often complex chains of sub-suppliers.  The cost, quality, and availability of the services, materials and components and finished products these ODMs and third parties supply are essential to our success.Our reliance on these ODMs and third parties therefore involves significant risks, including the following:&#8226;We rely on suppliers for critical aspects of our business.  For instance, we obtain a majority of our Bluetooth products from GoerTek, Inc.  Suppliers such as GoerTek may choose to discontinue supplying materials and components or finished products to us for a variety of reasons, including availability and price.  Although we design products for durability and long life cycles with an emphasis on common components across multiple product lines, the accelerating pace of technological advancement by our suppliers frequently makes it more difficult to continue to procure essential components like integrated circuits for those of our products already in the market.  Consequently, the failure to obtain key components to meet customer demand may (i) require us to obtain a replacement supply of satisfactory quality which may be difficult, time-consuming, or costly, (ii) force us to redesign or end-of-life certain products, (iii) delay manufacturing or render us unable to meet customer demand, or (iv) require us to make large last-time buys based on speculative long-term forecasts in excess of our short-term needs, holding materials and components or finished products in inventory for extended periods of time or underestimating our needs and being unable to meet customer demand.  Consequently, if one or more suppliers is unable or unwilling to meet our demand, delivery, or price requirements, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.&#8226;Although we endeavor to use standard materials and components in our products whenever feasible, the lack of viable alternative sources or the high development costs associated with existing and emerging wireless and other technologies may require us to work with a single source for silicon chips, chip-sets, or other materials and components in one or more products.  Moreover, lead times are particularly long for silicon-based components incorporating radio frequency and digital signal processing technologies and such materials and components make up an increasingly larger portion of our product costs.&#160;&#160;Additionally, many orders for consumer products have shorter lead times than component lead times, making it necessary for us or our suppliers to carry more inventory in anticipation of orders, which may not materialize.&#8226;A substantial portion of the materials and components used in our products are provided by our suppliers on consignment.  As such, we do not take title to the materials and components until they are consumed in the production process.  Prior to consumption, title and risk of loss remains with the suppliers.  Our supply agreements generally allow us to return parts in excess of maximum order quantities at the suppliers&#8217; expense.  Returns for other reasons are negotiated with suppliers on a case-by-case basis and are generally immaterial.  If we are required or choose to purchase all or a material portion of the consigned materials and components or if a material number of our suppliers refuse to accept orders on consignment, our inventory turn rate may decline or we could incur material unanticipated expenses, including write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory.&#8226;Rapid increases in production levels to meet product demand, whether or not forecasted, could result in shipment delays, higher costs for materials and components, increased expenditures for freight to expedite delivery of required materials, late delivery penalties, and higher overtime costs and other expenses, any of which could materially negatively impact our revenues, reduce profit margins, and harm relationships with affected customers.  For instance, in Fiscal Year 2015, sales of our BackBeat Fit were constrained by limited sub-component supply availability.  If similar constraints were to occur in existing or future product lines our ability to meet demand and our corresponding ability to sell affected products may be materially reduced.  Moreover, our failure to timely deliver desirable products to meet demand may harm relationships with our customers.  Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing yields may decrease, which may also reduce our revenues or margins.Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.&#32;11Table of Contents

We have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in prices from our suppliers, particularly in light of price fluctuations for oil, gold, copper, and other materials and components in the U.S. and around the world, which could negatively affect our profitability or market share.  If we are unable to pass cost increases on to our customers or achieve operating efficiencies that offset any increases, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

All of the markets in which we sell our products are intensely competitive and market leadership may change as a result of new product introductions, new market participants and pricing.  We face pressure on our selling prices, sales terms and conditions, and in connection with product performance and functionality.  Also, aggressive industry pricing practices may result in decreasing margins.One of our primary competitors is GN Netcom, a subsidiary of GN Store Nord A/S (&#8220;GN&#8221;), a Danish telecommunications conglomerate with whom we compete in the Enterprise and mobile categories. We also compete with consumer electronics companies that manufacture and sell mobile phones or computer peripheral equipment.  Many of our competitors are larger, offer broader product lines, may integrate their products with communications headset devices and adapters manufactured by them or others, offer products incompatible with our headsets, and have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources.Competitors in audio devices vary by product line. &#160;For sales of our Enterprise products, including UC, our largest competitors include GN and Sennheiser Communications.  In our Consumer market, our mono Bluetooth communication headsets for cell phones compete with GN's Jabra brand, Motorola, Samsung, and LG, among many others.  Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than us, and each has an established market position.  For our Stereo Consumer products, our primary competitors include Apple, Sennheiser, Beats, LG, Logitech, Samsung and Bose.  In the gaming category of our Consumer products market, our primary competitors are Turtle Beach, Skullcandy, Logitech and Razer.We face additional competition from companies, principally located in or originating from the Asia Pacific region, which offer very low cost products, including headsets modeled on, direct copies of, or counterfeits of our products.  Furthermore, online marketplaces make it easier for disreputable and fraudulent sellers to introduce their copies or counterfeit products into the stream of commerce by commingling legitimate products with copies and counterfeits; thereby making it extremely difficult to track and remove copies and counterfeits.  The introduction of low cost alternatives, copies and counterfeits has resulted in and will continue to cause market pricing pressure, customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation and brand name.  If headset prices are substantially reduced by new or existing market participants, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Likewise, if we do not distinguish our products, through distinctive, technologically advanced features and design, as well as continue to build and strengthen our brand recognition, our products may become commoditized and our business could be harmed.&#160;&#160;In addition, failure to effectively market our products to customers could lead to lower and more volatile revenue and earnings, excess inventory, and the inability to recover associated development costs, any of which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Competition in the markets for our Consumer products, which consist primarily of Bluetooth headsets, gaming, entertainment and computer audio headsets, is intense and presents many significant manufacturing, marketing and operational risks and uncertainties.  The risks include the following:&#8226;The global market for mono Bluetooth continues to decrease, which is at least partially attributable to the integration of Bluetooth systems into automobiles.  The market for stereo Bluetooth headsets continues to grow rapidly, although it remains dominated by lifestyle brands.  Our market share has been and is significantly larger in the mono Bluetooth than stereo Bluetooth market and thus far we have been unable to sufficiently increase share in the stereo Bluetooth market to offset decreases in the mono Bluetooth market.&#8226;Reductions in the number of suppliers participating in the Bluetooth market has reduced our sourcing options and may in the future increase our costs at a time when our ability to offset higher costs with product price increases is limited.&#8226;Difficulties retaining or obtaining shelf space and maintaining a robust and compelling eCommerce presence for our Consumer products in our sales channel, particularly with large "brick and mortar" retailers and Internet "etailers" as the market for mono Bluetooth headsets contracts.&#8226;Relying on a dwindling number of retail customers that have significant market share in the shrinking mono Bluetooth category increases our exposure to pricing pressure, unexpected changes in demand and may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our revenues and margins.&#32;12Table of Contents&#8226;The varying pace and scale of economic activity in many regions of the world creates demand uncertainty and unpredictability for our Consumer products.&#8226;The need to rapidly and frequently adopt new technology to keep pace with changing market trends.&#160;&#160;In particular, we anticipate a trend towards more integrated solutions that combine audio, video, and software functionality that we expect will shorten product lifecycles.&#8226;Our ability to maintain insight into, and quickly respond to, sudden changes in laws or regulations.Failure to compete successfully in the consumer business markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We have significant operations in various tax jurisdictions throughout the world, and a substantial portion of our taxable income has historically been generated in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Currently, some of our operations are taxed at rates substantially lower than U.S. tax rates.  If our income in these lower tax jurisdictions were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates, the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed, or the mix of our earnings shifts from lower rate jurisdictions to higher rate jurisdictions, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.Various governmental tax authorities have recently increased their scrutiny of tax strategies employed by corporations and individuals.  In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued guidelines and proposals during Fiscal Year 2016 that may change how our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.&#32;14Table of ContentsWe are also subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities, including state revenue agencies and foreign governments.  While we regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from examinations by the IRS and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there can be no assurance that the actual outcome resulting from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We own and operate a manufacturing facility in Tijuana, Mexico, which is responsible for assembly of a significant portion of our Enterprise products from materials and components sourced in Asia from various suppliers, contact manufacturers, and other vendors. Additionally, our Tijuana facility is primarily responsible for the packaging and final processing of most of our Consumer products after manufacturing and assembly by third parties, many of which are located in Asia. Also, we generate a significant amount of our revenues from foreign customers.Our international operations and sales expose us to various risks including, among others:&#8226;Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;&#8226;Cultural differences in the conduct of business;&#8226;Greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;&#8226;The impact of recessionary, volatile or adverse global economic conditions;&#8226;Reduced intellectual property rights protections in some countries;&#8226;Different and changing regulatory requirements;&#8226;The implementation or expansion of trade restrictions, sanctions or other penalties against one or more countries, its citizens or industries;&#8226;Unstable or uncertain political and economic situations such as the United Kingdom&#8217;s decision to leave the European Union;&#8226;Tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers, particularly in developing nations such as Brazil, India, and others;&#8226;Political conditions, health epidemics, civil unrest, or criminal activities within countries in which we operate;&#8226;The management, operation, and expenses associated with an enterprise spread over various countries;&#8226;The burden and administrative costs of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;&#8226;Currency restrictions; and&#8226;Compliance with anti-bribery laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom's Bribery Act.Additionally, proposals to impose tariffs, border taxes, and other actions related to the importation of goods from Mexico as well as renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada have been suggested by the United States Government.  Considering the nature and extent of our operations in Tijuana, our revenues and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted should any legislation or executive actions take effect that limit the amount and types of goods imported from Canada or Mexico or increase the cost of goods imported from either or both of those countries.  Alternatively, we may deem it is necessary to alter all or a portion of our domestic and international activities in response to legislation or executive actions which may increase our capital and operating costs both in the short and long-term.The above-listed and other inherent risks of international operations could materially and adversely affect regional economic activity and business operations in general, which in turn may harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.&#32;16Table of Contents

Historically, we have sold substantially all of our hardware products through distributors, retailers, OEMs, and telephony service providers.  Effectively managing these relationships and avoiding channel conflicts is challenging.  Our existing relationships with these parties are generally not exclusive and can be terminated by us or them without cause on short notice.  These customers also sell or may sell products offered by our competitors.  To the extent our competitors offer more favorable terms or more compelling products, our customers may not recommend, de-emphasize, or discontinue carrying our products.  Moreover, our OEMs may elect to manufacture their own products similar to those we offer.Additionally, it is becoming easier for small online sellers to enter the market unburdened with physical locations, employees and support personnel which can force our larger traditional brick and mortar resellers to reduce their selling prices.  In turn, our traditional resellers may demand lower selling prices from us, more cooperative and marketing incentives, reduce their sales support needed to maintain our premium brand image, discontinue carrying our products and other similar adverse actions.  As we begin to expand our offerings to include services, many of our historical channel partners may be unwilling or unable to market our services forcing us to establish new or different relationships.  Further, increased competition among resellers may cause some of our resellers and partners to experience financial difficulties or force them to shut down, decreasing our channels to market.  The inability to establish or maintain successful relationships with distributors, OEMs, retailers, and telephony service providers or to expand our distribution channels and sales models could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Also, in order to provide us with greater insight into the characteristics and motivations of our distribution channels as well as the needs of our end customers and to better incentivize our sales partners and promote our products to end customers, we have begun regional implementation of an authorization program as well as a back end rebate program.  Under the authorization program, distributors and resellers are asked to enter into agreements or supplement existing agreements in connection with the sale of all or a portion of our products.  The back end rebate program ties payment of post-sale discounts to distributor program compliance obligations.  These programs are new and our partners may deem them difficult, time-consuming or disruptive, or the terms of the programs or our agreements unacceptable.Additionally, in North America we have implemented an electronic minimum advertised pricing policy applicable to a number of new and future products as well as certain legacy products.  The policy allows us to limit and reject orders from resellers who fail to promote and maintain the premium image of our brand and products by advertising online prices for covered products below prices we establish and periodically adjust.  Enforcement of the policy may result in lost sales and harm our business relationships and reputation, potentially materially, with one or more customers or resellers.Moreover, we have an extensive global distribution network of distribution partners making it difficult to identify and enforce contractual breaches and violations of law including, without limitation, import and export violations, extraterritorial or &#8220;grey market&#8221; sales, sales to unauthorized, unqualified and disreputable resellers, copyright and trademark violations and other similar activities.  The advent of global Internet-based commerce and sharp decreases in the cost to quickly ship products internationally has exacerbated the problem, increasing the likelihood of commoditization of our products and harming our premier image with reputable resellers and end user customers.If the number and quality of our distributors and resellers declines or we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with distributors and resellers for our new offerings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.

Our customer mix is changing, and certain retailers, OEMs, and wireless carriers are more significant.&#160;&#160;In particular, we have several large customers whose order patterns are difficult to predict.  Offers and promotions by these customers may result in significant fluctuations in their purchasing activities over time, which may increase the volatility of our revenues.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to correctly anticipate the quantities and timing of their purchase requirements, our revenues may be adversely affected, or we may be left holding large volumes of inventory that cannot be sold to other customers.&#32;17Table of ContentsFurthermore, many customers with whom we conduct business are quite large with substantial buying power or who have strategic importance to our product marketing objectives.  Many use their buying power or strategic importance to mandate onerous terms and conditions to conduct business including unfavorable payment terms, late and inaccurate shipping fees and penalties, generous return rights, most favored pricing, and mandatory marketing and promotional fees.  These terms are often non-negotiable and are frequently broad, ambiguous and inconsistent across customers making compliance complex and subject to interpretation.  If our compliance with these or similar future provisions are incorrect or inadequate, we could be liable for breach of contract damages or our reputation with one or more key customers could be materially adversely harmed, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We are increasingly incorporating advanced software features and functionalities into our products, offering firmware and software fixes, updates, and upgrades and developing Internet based software-as-a-service offerings that provide additional value that complements our headsets.  As the nature and extent of software integration in our products increases or if sales of standalone software applications or services become material, the way we report revenue related to our products and services could be significantly affected.  For example, we are increasingly required to evaluate whether our revenue transactions include multiple deliverables and, as such, whether the revenue generated by each transaction should be recognized upon delivery, over a period of time or apportioned and recognized based on a combination of the two.  Moreover, the software and services revenue recognition rules are complex and dynamic.  If we fail to accurately apply these complex rules and policies, particularly to new and unique products or services offerings, we may incorrectly report revenues in one or more reporting periods.  If this were to occur and the error was material, we may be required to restate our financial statements, which could materially and adversely impact our results for the affected periods, cause our stock price to decline, and result in securities class actions or other similar litigation.

We continue to review our product portfolio and address our non-strategic product categories and products through various options including divestiture and cessation of operations. If we are unable to effect sales on favorable terms or if realignment is more costly or distracting than we expect or has a negative effect on our organization, employees and retention, then our business and operating results may be adversely affected. Discontinuing products with service components may also cause us to continue to incur expenses to maintain services within the product life cycle or to adversely affect our customer and consumer relationships and brand. Divestitures may also involve warranties, indemnification or covenants that could restrict our business or result in litigation, additional expenses or liabilities. In addition, discontinuing product categories, even categories that we consider non-strategic, reduces the size and diversification of our business and causes us to be more dependent on a smaller number of product categories.As we attempt to grow our business in strategic product categories and emerging market geographies, we will consider growth through acquisition or investment, including through joint ventures. We will evaluate acquisition opportunities that could provide us with additional product or service offerings or with additional industry expertise, assets and capabilities. Such endeavors and acquisitions will involve significant risks and uncertainties which may include:&#8226;Distraction of management from current operations;&#8226;Greater than expected liabilities and expenses;&#8226;Inadequate return on capital;&#8226;Insufficient sales and marketing expertise requiring costly and time-consuming development and training of internal sales and marketing personnel as well as new and existing distribution channels;&#8226;Certain structures such as joint ventures may limit management or operational control because of the nature of their organizational structures;&#8226;Difficulties integrating acquired operations, products, technology, internal controls, personnel and management teams;&#8226;Dilutive issuances of our equity securities and incurrence of debt;&#8226;Litigation;&#8226;Prohibitive or ineffective intellectual property rights or protections;&#8226;Unknown market expectations regarding pricing, branding and operational and logistical levels of support;&#8226;Uncertain tax, legal and other regulatory compliance obligations and consequences;&#8226;New and complex data collection, maintenance, privacy and security requirements; and&#8226;Other unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations.Moreover, any acquisitions may not be successful in achieving our desired strategic, product, financial or other objectives or expectations, which would also cause our business to suffer. Acquisitions can also lead to large non-cash charges that can have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of write-offs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets and goodwill or the recording of stock-based compensation.&#32;18Table of Contents

We have announced or are exploring new service offerings including software-as-a-service, device-as-a-service and Soundscaping. Although, elements of each of these services are founded on intellectual property or one or more areas in which we believe we have expertise, they remain complex undertakings different in material respects from our historical hardware design, development and sales model.  For example, while software-as-a-service has become a familiar business model generally, recurring revenue subscription services are new to us and involve unique development, accounting and support.  Moreover, device-as-a-service and Soundscaping are not nearly as well-known or understood generally.  Device-as-a-service in particular involves significant up-front costs, limited product recovery options and may require significant sales and marketing educational campaigns both internally and throughout our distribution channels.  Furthermore, each of these services remain in the early stages of development and will require significant time, effort and costs to develop before we can determine their likelihood of market success.If we fail to anticipate the time, effort and cost to develop and maintain new business strategies, we do not timely meet market expectations for commercial availability, our service and support proves unreliable, or we are unable to offer these services at acceptable profit margins, our existing and future business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets, and other intellectual property, including our rights to certain domain names.  We rely primarily on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights.  Effective protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights may not be available in every country in which our products and media properties are distributed to customers.  The process of seeking intellectual property protection can be lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.  Patents may not be issued in response to our applications, and any that may be issued may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged by others.  If we are required to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation, the costs and diversion of management's attention could be substantial.  Furthermore, we may be countersued by an actual or alleged infringer if we attempt to enforce our intellectual property rights, which may materially increase our costs, divert management attention, and result in injunctive or financial damages being awarded against us.  In addition, existing patents, copyright registrations, trademarks, trade secrets and domain names may not provide competitive advantages or be adequate to safeguard and maintain our rights.  If it is not feasible or possible to obtain, enforce, or protect our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.Patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets are owned by third parties that may make claims or commence litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.  These claims or allegations may relate to intellectual property that we develop or that is incorporated in the materials or components provided by one or more suppliers. As we have grown, intellectual property rights claims against us and our suppliers have increased.  There has also been a general trend of increasing intellectual property infringement claims against corporations that make and sell products.  Our products, technologies and the components and materials contained in our products may be subject to certain third-party claims and, regardless of the merits of the claim, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate, settle, or otherwise resolve.  Many of our agreements with our distributors and resellers require us to indemnify them for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims.  To the extent claims against us or our suppliers are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue the manufacture and distribution of products that are found to be in violation of another party's rights.  We also may have to obtain, or renew on less favorable terms, licenses to manufacture and distribute our products or materials or components included in those products, which may significantly increase our operating expenses.  Discharging our indemnity obligations may involve time-consuming and expensive litigation and result in substantial settlements or damages awards, our products being enjoined, and the loss of a distribution channel or retail partner, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our operating results.&#32;19Table of Contents

Our products must meet existing and new requirements set by regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which we sell them.  For example, certain of our Enterprise products must meet local phone system standards.  Certain of our wireless products must work within existing permitted radio frequency ranges.  Moreover, competition for limited radio frequency bandwidth as a result of an increasing use of wireless products increases the risk of interference or diminished product performance.  For instance, in the U.S. the increase in the number of products operating in the unlicensed 903-928 megahertz radio frequency range using significantly higher power than our wireless products and those of many other users of the unlicensed frequency range may cause our wireless products to experience interference which, if material, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our sales.As regulations and local laws change, new regulations are enacted and competition increases, we may need to modify our products to address those changes.  Regulatory restrictions and competition may increase the costs to design, manufacture, and sell our products, resulting in a decrease in our margins or a decrease in demand for our products if we attempt to pass along the costs. Regulations may also negatively adversely affect our ability to procure or manufacture raw materials and components necessary for our products.   Compliance with regulatory restrictions and bandwidth limitations may impact the actual or perceived technical quality and capabilities of our products, reducing their marketability.  In addition, if the products we supply to various jurisdictions fail to comply with the applicable local or regional regulations, if our customers or merchants transfer products into unauthorized jurisdictions or our products interfere with the proper operation of other devices, we or consumers purchasing our products may be responsible for the damages that our products cause; thereby causing us to alter the performance of our products, pay substantial monetary damages or penalties, cause harm to our reputation, or cause us to suffer other adverse consequences.

We are regularly subject to a wide variety of litigation including claims, lawsuits, and other similar proceedings involving our business practices and products including product liability claims, labor and employment claims, and commercial disputes.  The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger, our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach, and our products and services have increased in complexity.For instance, the sales of our products expose us to the risk of product liability, including hearing loss claims.  Additionally, our mobile headsets are used with mobile telephones and there has been public controversy over whether the radio frequency emissions from mobile phones are harmful to users of mobile phones.  Likewise, research could establish a link between radio frequency emissions and corded or wireless headsets or we could become a party to litigation claiming such a link.There is also continuing public controversy over the use of mobile phones by operators of motor vehicles and we may be subject to allegations that use of a mobile phone in combination with a headset contributed to a motor vehicle accident.In addition, we have been sued by employees regarding our employment practices and business partners regarding contractual rights and obligations.  We have also been sued by a competitor, GN Netcom, Inc., regarding alleged violations of certain laws regulating competition and business practices, which lawsuit is more specifically described in Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) and Part II, Item 8, Note 8 (Commitments and Contingencies) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Related to the litigation with GN, the Company has also received a Notice of Proposed Debarment from the General Services Administration ("GSA") which matter is more specifically described in Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings).  If we are unsuccessful in our engagement with the GSA and a suspension or debarment is implemented, our revenues may decrease and our reputation may be harmed which, if material, may adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.Frequently, the outcome and impact of any claims, lawsuits, and other similar proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, regardless of the outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that is subject to judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments, penalties or to settle claims or proceedings, any of which could harm our business. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain products, or services, or requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways. Any of these consequences could materially harm our business.We maintain product liability insurance, general liability and other forms of insurance in amounts we believe sufficient to cover reasonably anticipated claims, including some of those described above;&#160;however, the coverage provided under the policies could be inapplicable or insufficient to cover the full amount of any one or more claims.  Consequently, claims brought against us, whether or not successful, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.&#32;20Table of Contents

The market price for our common stock has been affected and may continue to be affected by a number of factors, including:&#8226;Uncertain global and regional economic and geopolitical conditions, including slow or stagnant growth, inflationary pressures, political or military unrest;&#8226;Failure to meet our forecasts or the expectations and forecasts of securities analysts;&#8226;Changes in our guidance or announced forecasts that may or may not be consistent with the expectations of analysts or investors;&#8226;Quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations and changes in market share;&#8226;The announcement of new products, product enhancements, or partnerships by us or our competitors;&#8226;Our ability to develop, introduce, ship, and support new products and offerings and product enhancements and manage product transitions and recalls, if any;&#8226;Repurchases of our common shares under our repurchase plans or public announcement of our intention not to repurchase our common shares;&#8226;Our decision to declare dividends or increase or decrease dividends over historical rates;&#8226;The loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees;&#8226;Changes in earnings estimates, recommendations, or ratings by securities analysts or a reduction in the number of analysts following our stock;&#8226;Developments in our industry, including new or increased enforcement of existing governmental regulations related to our products and new or revised communications standards;&#8226;Concentrated ownership of our common stock by a limited number of institutional investors that may limit liquidity for investors interested in acquiring or selling positions in our common stock, particularly substantial positions;&#8226;Sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market by us, our officers or directors, or unaffiliated third parties, including institutional investors;&#8226;General economic, political, and market conditions, including market volatility;&#8226;Litigation brought by or against us; and&#8226;Other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.

Our success depends to a large extent upon the services of a limited number of executive officers and other key employees.  The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, whether or not anticipated, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  We also believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled technical, management, sales, and marketing personnel.  Competition for such personnel is intense and the salary, benefits and other costs to employ the right personnel may make it difficult to achieve our financial goals.  Consequently, we may not be successful in attracting, motivating and retaining such personnel, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.

We are subject to an innumerable and ever-increasing number of global laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information (&#8220;PII&#8221;) about our customers, end-users of our products, business partners and employees globally. Data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and often impose requirements that are inconsistent with one another. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information internally and by and between us and other parties with whom we have commercial relations. These laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and may materially increase our cost of doing business, particularly as we expand the nature and types of products and services we offer including, without limitation, our software-as-a-service and Soundscaping subscription services.Regulatory scrutiny of privacy, data protection, use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant damages, fines and penalties. In addition, compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provide services our customers, business partners and employees find valuable. A determination that there have been violations of privacy laws relating to our practices could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and subject us to reputational, legal and operational liabilities.We post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of PII. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other domestic or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If customers or end users were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.

We rely on networks, information systems, and other technology (&#8220;information systems&#8221;), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business activities, including our software-as-a-service, human resources, procurement, manufacturing, sales, distribution, invoicing, and collections.  We use information systems to process and report financial information internally and to comply with regulatory reporting.  In addition, we depend on information systems for communications with our suppliers, distributors, and customers.  Consequently, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns or service disruptions during routine operations, such as system upgrades or user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious software, hackers, natural disasters, communications interruptions, or other events (collectively, "network incidents"). Our computer systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to network incidents.  While, to date, we have not experienced a network incident resulting in material impairment to our operations, nor have we experienced material intentional or inadvertent disclosure of our data or information or the information or data of our customers or vendors, future network incidents could result in unintended disruption of our operations or disclosure of sensitive information or assets.  Furthermore, we may experience targeted attacks and although we continue to invest in personnel, technologies, and training to prepare for and reduce the adverse consequences of such attacks, these investments are expensive and do not guarantee that such attacks will be unsuccessful, either completely or partially.&#32;22Table of ContentsIf our information systems are disrupted or shutdown and we fail to timely and effectively resolve the issues, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results and we may lose revenue and profits.  Misuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations, damage our reputation, and have a negative impact on net operating results. In addition, we may suffer financial damage and damage to our reputation because of loss or misappropriation of our confidential information or assets, or those of our partners, customers, or suppliers.  We could also be required to expend significant effort and incur financial costs to remedy security breaches or to repair or replace networks and information systems.Additionally, regardless of the security measures we may employ, our systems and data remain vulnerable to theft, loss and destruction, fraud, unintentional disclosure, errors and similar disruptive activities from current and former employees. Although we have controls in place intended to discourage and detect these types of problems in accordance with industry standards, no system of controls is perfect and issues are likely to arise. If the problems are material, our reputation may be damaged, we may be exposed to litigation, our sales may be harmed and our business and financial results could be adversely impacted.

War, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters, or other business interruptions, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused or could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, us, and our suppliers or customers.&#160;&#160;Our major business operations and those of many of our vendors and their sub-suppliers (collectively, "Suppliers") are subject to interruption by disasters, including, without limitation, earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions or other natural or manmade disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, flu or similar epidemics or pandemics, and other events beyond our control and the control of our Suppliers.&#160;&#160;Our corporate headquarters, information technology, manufacturing, certain research and development activities, and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults or flood zones.&#160;&#160;While we are partially insured for earthquake-related losses or floods, our operating results and financial condition could be materially affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster.Should any of the events above arise we could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production, and disruptions in the operations of our Suppliers.&#160;&#160;Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by these events.

Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.  The issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.  In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could also have the effect of delaying or preventing our acquisition by a third party.  Further, certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws could delay or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.<div
