<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are descriptions of the
risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. We encourage you to carefully
consider all such risk factors when making investment decisions regarding our company. If any such risks, or any other risks that we do not currently consider to be material, or which are not known to

competitive, market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant sales, research and development and
manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results. Factors that may affect our operating results and/or the market price of our Common Stock

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our international sales and our operations in foreign countries expose us to risks associated with fluctuating currency values and exchange
rates. Gains and losses on the conversion of accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars may contribute to fluctuations in our results of
operations. In addition, since we conduct business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in each of our divisions. In the security and inspection and patient monitoring,
cardiology and anesthesia systems markets, competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance, functionality and quality, cost, prior customer relationships, technological
capabilities of the product, price, certification by government authorities, past performance, local market presence and breadth of sales and service organization. In the optoelectronic devices and
electronics manufacturing markets, competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices, product quality, timeliness of delivery, price,
customer technical support and on the ability to provide fully-integrated services from application development and
design through volume subsystem production. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and enhance our existing products
and services in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge and entire product lines or
service offerings may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines or service offerings. </FONT></P>

Continuing terrorist attacks worldwide have increased financial expectations that may not materialize.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing terrorist attacks worldwide create increased interest in our security and inspection systems and service offerings. However, we are
not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as it is now. We do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S.
Department of Defense, and similar agencies in other countries and whether our products will be a part of those solutions. Additionally, should our products and services be considered as a part of
future security solutions, it is unclear what the demand for our products and services may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products and services may be made available. These factors may
adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing, sale and service of security
and inspection systems as well as in the provision of training to our customers in the use and operation of such systems. Our customers use our security and inspection systems to help them detect
items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. Some of our security and inspection systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag, parcel,
container, vehicle or other vessel. Others signal to the operator that further investigation is required. In either case, the training, reliability and competence of the customer's operator are
crucial to the detection of suspicious items. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security
inspection systems that signal to the operator that further investigation is required are sometimes referred to in the security industry as "automatic" detection systems. Such

are probabilistic in nature and are also subject to significant technical limitations. Nevertheless, if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other
contraband was in fact present, resulting in significant damage, we could become the subject of significant product liability claims. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
security inspection by technological means is circumstance and application-specific. Our security and inspection systems are not designed to work under all circumstances and
can malfunction. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also offer turnkey security screening solutions under which we perform certain of the security screening tasks that have historically been performed by our customers. Such tasks
include: design, layout and construction of the security checkpoint where the inspection equipment is located; selection of the security equipment to be used at the checkpoint; selection, training and
management of the personnel operating the checkpoint; operation of the security screening equipment; interpretation of the images and other signals produced by the security screening equipment;
maintenance and security of the checkpoint as well as other related services. Such projects expose us to certain professional liability risks that are inherent in performing security inspection
services (in live checkpoint environments and over extended periods of time) for the purpose of assisting our customers in the detection of contraband items, including items that could be used in
performing terrorist acts or other crimes. If a contraband item were to pass through the checkpoint and be used to perform a terrorist act or other crime, we could become the subject of significant
professional liability claims. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, there are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims should an act of terrorism occur. Past terrorism attacks in the U.S. and in other
locations worldwide and the potential for future attacks have caused commercial insurance for such threats to become extremely difficult to obtain. Although we have been able to obtain insurance
coverage, it is likely that, should we be found liable following a major act of terrorism, the insurance we currently have in place would not fully cover the claims for damages. </FONT></P>

The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act) may not shield us against all legal claims we may face following an act of terrorism.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAFETY Act provides important legal liability protections for providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services. Under the SAFETY
Act, providers, such as our Security division, may apply to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for coverage of the products and services. If granted coverage, such providers would receive
certain legal protections against product liability, professional liability and certain other claims that could arise following an act of terrorism. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have applied to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for many of the products and services offered by our Security division but we do not enjoy coverage (or the highest level of
coverage) for every product line, model number and service offering that our Security division provides. In addition, the terms of the SAFETY Act coverage decisions awarded to us by the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security contain conditions and requirements that we may not (or may not be able to) continue to satisfy in the future. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the future, if we fail to maintain the coverage that we currently enjoy or fail to apply in a timely way for coverage for new products and services as we acquire or introduce them, or
if the U.S. Department of Homeland Security limits the scope of any coverage previously awarded to us, denies us coverage or continued coverage for a particular product, product line or service
offering, or delays in making decisions about whether to grant us coverage, we may become exposed to legal claims that the SAFETY Act was otherwise designed to prevent. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
SAFETY Act was not designed to shield providers of qualified anti-terrorism products and services from all types of claims that may arise from acts of terrorism, including from many
types of claims lodged in courts outside of the United States or acts of terrorism that occur outside of the United States. This too could leave us exposed to significant legal claims and litigation
defense costs despite the SAFETY Act awards we have received. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks, and we believe
our insurance coverage is consistent with general practices within our industry. However, the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear
substantial costs. While some of our products are shielded from liability within the U.S. under the SAFETY Act, no such protection is available outside the U.S., potentially resulting in significant

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development, manufacturing and sale of medical devices expose us to significant risk of product liability claims, product recalls and,
sometimes, product failure claims. We face an inherent business risk of financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our medical devices results in personal injury or death.
Substantial product liability litigation currently exists within the medical device industry. Some of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems products may become subject
to product liability claims and/or product recalls. Future product liability claims and/or product recall costs may exceed the limits of our insurance coverages or such insurance may not continue to
be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, a significant product liability claim or product recall could significantly damage our reputation for producing safe,
reliable and effective products, making it more difficult for us to market and sell our products in the future. Consequently, a product liability claim, product recall or other claim could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quality is extremely important to us and our customers, due in part to the serious consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications
are critical both to the marketing success of our goods and services and to the satisfaction of both regulatory and contractual requirements under which we sell many of our products. If we fail to

As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to extensive Federal procurement rules and regulations as well as contractual obligations that are unique to doing business with the

Government agencies and the agencies of certain other governments with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event we generally may

damages and significant civil penalties. The U.S. Government may also initiate administrative proceedings that, if resulting in an adverse finding against us or any of our subsidiaries as to our
present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in our company or our subsidiaries being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new
government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges and, if satisfying the requisite level of seriousness, in our debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government for a specified
term as well as being subject to other remedies available to the U.S. Government. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
example, subsidiaries within our Security division received a "show cause" letter in November 2012 from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration and a related Notice for
Proposed Debarment from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in May 2013. Although, with respect to that "show cause" letter and Notice for Proposed Debarment, we ultimately reached an
Administrative Agreement with the U.S. Government, which allowed us to continue with our current and future business with U.S. Government agencies, there is no assurance that we would be able to reach
a similar outcome with respect to any future proceedings in which we may become involved, whether related to the same or new matters. In addition, if our Security division fails to remain in
compliance with its current Administrative Agreement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security could initiate debarment proceedings. </FONT></P>

The loss of certain of our customers, including government agencies that can modify or terminate agreements more easily than other commercial customers with which we contract, the

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further,
we are generating revenues from certain customers, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our contract with the Mexican
government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various locations throughout the country is scheduld to expire in January 2018. Revenue attributable to this contract comprised
approximately 12% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended June&nbsp;30, 2017. The termination, non-renewal or reduction in scope of this contract, or the renewal of this contract with reduced
scope or on other modified terms, even if for reasons unrelated to the quality of our products or services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations, including, but not limited to, impairment of capital assets purchased or manufactured specifically for this contract. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Our revenues are dependent on orders of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening solutions and patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems,
which may have lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales of security and inspection systems and turnkey security screening solutions often depend upon the decision of governmental agencies to
upgrade or expand existing airports, border crossing inspection sites, seaport inspection sites, military facilities and other security installations. In the case of turnkey security screening
solutions, the commencement of screening operations may be dependent on the approval, by a government agency, of the protocols and procedures that our personnel are to follow during the performance of
their activities. Sales outside of the United States of our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems depend in significant part on the decision of governmental agencies to
build new medical facilities or to expand or update existing medical facilities. Accordingly, a significant portion of our sales of security and inspection systems, turnkey security screening
solutions and our patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes. During these approval periods, we expend
significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future revenues that may not occur. If we fail to receive such revenues after expending such resources, such failure could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
U.S and foreign budget control provisions could reduce government spending, which could adversely impact our revenues, earnings, cash flows and financial condition.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), committing the U.S. Government to significantly reduce the federal
deficit over ten years. The BCA contains provisions commonly referred to as "sequestration", which call for substantial, unspecified automatic spending cuts split between defense and non-defense
programs that may continue for a period of ten years. The BCA also included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will stay in
effect through 2024, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Likewise, various European governments have implemented or intend to implement austerity measures intended to reduce government
spending. Such measures may reduce demand for our products directly by affected governmental agencies and by our customers who derive revenues from these governmental agencies or governmental
healthcare programs. We cannot currently predict the impact of governmental spending reductions on us or our customers or whether and to what extent our business and results of operations may be
adversely harmed. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our projects require the expenditure of substantial management and financial resources in anticipation of future revenue generation.
For example, in 2012, we entered into a substantial six-year contract with the Mexican government to provide a turnkey security screening solution at various sites throughout Mexico, which required
substantial expenditures for capital equipment and infrastructure. Although to date we have performed well under this contract, if our performance declines during the remainder of this contract, this
could inhibit our ability to renew the contract prior to its scheduled expiration in January 2018, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We anticipate that future contracts for turnkey security screening solutions in other territories could also require the outlay and management of substantial financial resources for
capital equipment and infrastructure. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turnkey
screening solutions projects, in contrast to the sale and installation of security inspection equipment, also require that we hire and manage large numbers of local personnel in

construction of the facilities that will house our systems and/or operations. Some of these construction projects are significant in size and complexity. We engage qualified construction firms to
perform this work. However, if such firms experience delays, if they perform sub-standard work or if we fail to properly monitor the quality of their work or the timeliness of their progress, we may
not be able to complete our construction projects on time. In any such circumstance, we could face the imposition of delay penalties and breach of contract claims by our customer. In addition, we

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We contract with third-party vendors to service our equipment in the field. We have made such arrangements because sometimes it is more
efficient to outsource these activities than it is for our own employees to service our equipment. In addition, some of these vendors maintain stocks of spare parts that are more efficiently accessed
in conjunction with a service agreement than would be the case if we were to maintain such spare parts independently. Any material interruption in the ability of our vendors to fulfill such service

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of long lead times and specialized product designs, in certain cases we purchase components and manufacture products in anticipation of
customer orders based on customer forecasts. For a variety of reasons, such as decreased end-user demand for our products, inadequate or inaccurate forecasts, or other issues that might impact
production planning, our customers might not purchase all the products that we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components. In any such event, we would attempt to recoup material and
manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors, disposing of excess inventory through other channels, or requiring our OEM customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us
for such excess inventory. However, some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our OEM customers to do this. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in
recouping our material and manufacturing costs, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because of the complex customer

on June&nbsp;23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as "Brexit". The
impact of Brexit depends on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which still need to be determined and could take several years to accomplish. The UK's withdrawal from the EU could result in
a global economic downturn, which could depress the demand for our products and services. The UK also could lose access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on
behalf of its members, depressing trade between the
UK and other countries, which would negatively impact our international operations. Additionally, we may face new regulations regarding trade, security and employees, among others in the UK.
Compliance with such regulations could be costly, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees, many of whom are individually key to our

While our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for us to be successful, ultimately, we may not be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All third-party payers, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the United States or outside, are developing increasingly
sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. These cost-control methods also potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices. In the United
States, hospital and other healthcare provider customers, including physicians and ambulatory surgery centers, that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payers to cover all or a
portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures or tests in which our products are used and bill patients for any deductibles or co-payments. Because there is often no separate
reimbursement for our products, any decline in the amount payers are willing to reimburse our customers for the procedures and tests associated with our products could make it difficult for customers
to continue using, or adopt, our products and create additional pricing pressure for us. If we are forced to lower the price we charge for our products, our gross margins will decrease, which will
adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business. </FONT></P>

have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, and some could significantly affect the ways in which
doctors, hospitals, healthcare systems and health insurance companies are compensated for the services they provide, which could have a material impact on our business. It is not clear at this time
what changes may impact the ability of hospitals and hospital networks to purchase the patient monitoring, diagnostic cardiology and anesthesia systems that we sell or if it will alter market-based

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts

future products may not obtain FDA clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Further, the FDA makes periodic inspections of medical device manufacturers and in connection with such

The expense and costs of any corrective actions that we may take, which may include product recalls, correction and removal of products from customer sites and/or changes to our product manufacturing

We must continually monitor the performance of our products once approved and marketed for signs that their use may elicit serious and unexpected adverse effects. Any recall of our
products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products that leads to corrective actions, could have
a material adverse impact on us.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we believe that existing data continue to support the efficacy and safety of our patient monitoring, cardiology, and anesthesia
products, in the future, longer term study outcomes could demonstrate conflicting clinical effectiveness, a reduction of effectiveness, no clinical effectiveness or longer term safety issues. This
type of differing data could have a detrimental effect on the market penetration and usage of our medical device products. As a result, our sales may decline or expected growth would be negatively

generally, all medical devices can experience performance problems that require review and possible corrective action by us or a component supplier. We cannot provide assurance that
component failures, manufacturing errors, noncompliance with quality system requirements or good manufacturing practices, design defects and/or labeling inadequacies in any device that could result in
an unsafe condition or injury to the patient will not occur. The FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of
material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers may also, under their own initiative, stop
shipment or recall a product if any material deficiency is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur
as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, noncompliance with good manufacturing practices or quality system requirements, design or labeling defects or
other deficiencies and issues. Similar regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall products because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could
endanger health. A recall involving our products could be particularly harmful to our business, financial and operating results. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Notice to the FDA of a correction or removal is
required when undertaken to reduce a risk to health, including when there is a reasonable probability that the product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death, or when use of the
device may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or an outcome where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. In addition, companies are required
to maintain certain records of corrections and removal, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or similar foreign governmental authorities. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products
in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or foreign governmental authorities. If the FDA or foreign governmental authorities disagree with our determinations, they could
require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or a foreign governmental
authority could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted. </FONT></P>

addition, under the FDA's medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or
serious injury or in which our
product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product

risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the
courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other
things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or
specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a

be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses
and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that

satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Common Stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all
of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under
applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net

(Including Partial Cash Settlement), subsequently codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options ("ASC 470-20"), an entity must separately account for the
liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer's
economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders'
equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result,
we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face
amount over the term of the Notes. Because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period's amortization of the debt discount and the instrument's coupon interest, we will report
lower net income in our financial results, and the trading price of our Common Stock and the trading price of the Notes could be materially and adversely affected. </FONT></P>

conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of
Common Stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to
permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted earnings per share

taxation on earnings outside of the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States, could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. In addition, many countries in the
European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws.
Certain proposals could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international
business activities, any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;text-align:justify"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture
products that contain certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals
originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of
certain of our products. In addition, we incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in
our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to ascertain the origins for these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may
harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these
customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at
competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.  </FONT></P>
