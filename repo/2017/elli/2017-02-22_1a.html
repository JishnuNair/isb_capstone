If any of the following risks materialize, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Because of the following risks, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Any future outages or system interruptions that impair access to Encompass, the Ellie Mae Network or our other services could damage our reputation and brand and may substantially harm our business and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The satisfactory performance, reliability, and availability of Encompass, the Ellie Mae Network and our other services are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain Encompass users and Ellie Mae Network participants. Because our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, and we have from time to time found errors and defects in our services and new errors and defects in our services may be detected in the future.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Moreover, we have experienced and may in the future continue to experience temporary system interruptions to Encompass, the Ellie Mae Network, or our other services for a variety of other reasons, including network failures, power failures, problems with Encompass and other third-party firmware updates, as well as an overwhelming number of users or Ellie Mae Network participants trying to access our services during periods of strong demand. In addition, our services may be subject to security or denial of services attacks which result in service interruptions or our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation and brand, reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses, negatively impact our ability to run our business, hinder our ability to enroll new customers, cause us to incur legal liability or issue refunds or service credits to our customers and cause us to lose current customers, all of which could substantially harm our business and operating results. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We utilize a hybrid cloud approach to our third-party data centers consisting of (i) two primary production data centers, located in Santa Clara, California, and Chicago, Illinois, which are each hosted by a third-party service provider and (ii) a network of Amazon Web Services (&#8220;AWS&#8221;) data centers which provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations. We maintain regular oversight but have little direct control over our two primary data centers. In the case of AWS, we do not control any aspects of the AWS data center operations and do not own any of the underlying computing hardware. We rely on these third-party service providers to provide continuous and uninterrupted access to our products and services, including Encompass and the Ellie Mae Network. If for any reason our relationship with any of these third parties were to end unexpectedly, it could require a significant amount of time to transition the hosting of our computing infrastructure to new third-party service providers. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We are also subject to interruptions beyond our and our third-party service providers&#8217; control, such as disruptions or congestion in the portions of the Internet linking us to our customers. We are dependent on third parties for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our systems and because some of the causes of system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner. These interruptions may affect our customers&#8217; experience or cause us to lose customers, and may materially harm our reputation and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our failure to secure the confidential information of the customers of the users of our software and services could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We collect, process, transmit, and maintain certain confidential information relating to the customers (borrowers and loan applicants) of the users of our software and services, including personally identifiable information. This information resides on data center servers hosted by third-party providers, and is transmitted to, across, and from our networks. While we have security measures in place to protect this information and prevent security breaches, these security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, advanced persistent cyber-attacks (by hacktivists or cybercriminal organizations), employee error or malfeasance, service provider or vendor error, malfeasance or other intentional </font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">15</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">or unintentional acts by third parties. Furthermore, our customers&#8217; data, including personally identifiable information, may be lost, exposed, or subject to unauthorized access and/or use as a result of accidents, errors, or malfeasance by our employees, independent contractors, or others working with us or on our behalf. Our servers and systems, and those of our service providers, may also be vulnerable to computer malware, break-ins, denial-of service attacks, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers&#8217; data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. The possession and use of personal information in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers in the event of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information, and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches or the loss or exposure of confidential information or other information we maintain or process. Any actual or perceived compromise of our security could result in the loss of customer data, intellectual property or trade secrets, and could damage our reputation and brand, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, adversely affect investor confidence, and expose us to a risk of litigation or regulatory actions and orders,  penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations and/or other liabilities, which would substantially harm our business and operating results. We will need to expend significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our future performance will be highly dependent on our ability to continue to attract new Encompass customers and users of our other service offerings.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">To maintain or increase our revenues, we may need to increase the number of users of our Encompass software and other service offerings, and the failure to do so may have a materially adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to increase the number of Encompass customers or users of our other services, our business may be materially adversely affected. Our success will depend on both (i) the willingness of mortgage lenders to continue to accept the SaaS model for delivering software applications that they view as critical to the success of their business and (ii) our ability to successfully deliver new SaaS service offerings.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services, the future growth rate and size of the mortgage technology market or the entry of competitive applications. The growth of the mortgage technology market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with product offerings, most notably SaaS offerings such as our own, including the extent to which SaaS companies are successful in continuing to address security and reliability concerns. If other SaaS providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for SaaS applications as a whole, including our own products and services, may be negatively affected. If there is a reduction in demand for mortgage technology caused by technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies, and products, decreases in spending by mortgage lenders, it could result in decreased revenues and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we will need to continue to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our software requires significant time, expense, and attention.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If we are not able to provide successful enhancements, new features and modifications to our services, our business could be adversely affected. Further, impairment of software-related assets and other assets may materially adversely affect our operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">If we are unable to provide enhancements, new features, and modifications of our existing services, including the successful completion and deployment of our next generation Encompass software and the Encompass Lending Platform and changes to our services to reflect changes in laws and regulations relating to residential mortgage lending, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we do not successfully manage the migration of our customers to our next generation Encompass software or if the transition takes longer than expected, customers may not experience the benefits of new enhancements and features and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in software, communication, browser, database and SaaS infrastructure technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion which could increase our costs and adversely affect our business. The failure of our services to operate effectively with future technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We have invested and continue to invest significant resources to develop and acquire technology related to our services that is capitalized to property and equipment or intangible assets and treated as an asset on our balance sheet.&#160;We may not launch this new technology, the launch of such technology may result in disruptions to our business operations or such technology might not meet our and our customers&#8217; expectations.

In December 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank raised the target federal funds rate from between 0.25% and 0.50% to between 0.50% and 0.75%, and signaled that the federal funds rate could be increased further over the next several years. This increase in the federal funds rate contributed to an increase in mortgage rates in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017 and may result in future mortgage interest rate increases. Increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce the volume of new mortgages originated materially, in particular the volume of mortgage refinancings. In addition, our on-demand revenues typically, but not always, track the seasonality of the residential mortgage industry, with increased activity in the second and third quarter and reduced activity in the first and fourth quarters as home buyers tend to purchase their homes during the spring and summer in order to move to a new home before the start of the school year. As a result, a higher percentage of our on-demand revenues have historically been recognized during those quarters.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">currently estimate that approximately</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">35%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">45%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of our revenues </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">have some direct sensitivity to volume</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. A decrease in residential mortgage volumes could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, a significant decrease in mortgage volume could negatively impact our customers, resulting in a reduction of their Encompass users, consolidation with other lenders or cessation of operations. If any of these occurs, it could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenues and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which ranges from one to five years. They may also choose to renew their subscriptions at lower levels. In addition, in the first year of a subscription, customers often purchase a higher level of professional services than they do in renewal years. As a result, our ability to grow is dependent in part on customers purchasing additional subscriptions and services after the initial subscription term. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our customers&#8217; renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, changes to the standard prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers&#8217; spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional subscriptions or services, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability and gross margin percentage may be harmed.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:18px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our future performance will be highly dependent on our ability to expand the use of settlement services on, and increase the number of transactions effected through, the Ellie Mae Network.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">To grow our base of Ellie Mae Network participants, we and settlement service providers must continue to enhance the features and functionality of offerings to them. In addition, increasing the number of settlement service transactions effected through the Ellie Mae Network will depend, in part, on settlement service providers enhancing their technical capabilities, which is largely beyond our control.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We must also convince a variety of potential Ellie Mae Network participants, including mortgage lenders, originators, settlement service providers, and mega lenders, of the benefits of electronic origination and network participation as compared to traditional mortgage origination methods including paper, facsimile, courier, mail, and email.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We cannot guarantee that our Ellie Mae Network and other service offerings will achieve market acceptance.

In addition, our operating results in future periods may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who follow our company, which could cause our stock price to decline rapidly and significantly. The results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Since part of our sales efforts are targeted at larger customers, our sales cycle may become longer and more expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Part of our business strategy is to target larger mortgage lenders that handle greater volumes of loans. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger customers, we could face greater costs, longer sales cycles, and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market, the customer&#8217;s decision to use our products and services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, this type of sale could require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our products and services. In addition, larger customers may demand more complex integration, implementation services, and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay&#160;revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management and administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Additional investments in our implementation capabilities, technical support, technical operations, research and development, and general and administrative functions will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, address the needs of our customers, further develop and enhance our products and services, and scale with the overall growth of our company.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition, professional services, such as implementation services, are a key aspect of on-boarding new customers. The implementation process is complicated and we will need to scale our capabilities in this area to meet future revenue targets. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer&#8217;s dissatisfaction with our products and services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">18</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our growth strategy will require significant expenditures and resources to improve our technology, systems, and operational infrastructure in order to support a growing number of customers.

As our operations grow in size, scope, and complexity, we will need to expand, improve, and upgrade our technology systems and, operational infrastructure, including the capabilities of the third-party data centers we utilize to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced solutions, features and functionality, and to ensure that our services are reliable.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our growth and the improvement of our technology systems and operational infrastructure will require significant lead time and substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of the anticipated increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business or our revenues will actually increase. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We have experienced rapid growth.

We anticipate that we will significantly expand our operations and headcount in the near term, and will continue to expand our customer base. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, general and administrative resources, and operational infrastructure. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively and to scale our operations. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. As we continue to grow, we also need to ensure that our policies and procedures evolve to reflect our current operations and are appropriately communicated to and observed by employees, and that we appropriately manage our corporate information assets, including confidential and proprietary information. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in deploying customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and results of operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Completing and integrating future acquisitions could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition, and operating results or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our solutions and services and to grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures.

In addition, we have updated certain products to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule changes and the 2013 Loan Originator Rule under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z) (TILA-RESPA Amendments) that became effective October 3, 2015. The final rule amending Regulation C to implement amendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) made by section 1094 of the Dodd-Frank Act was published on October 15, 2015. It includes various effective compliance dates, starting with January 1, 2017 through May 30, 2020. The final "Qualified Residential Mortgage" rule which implements the risk retention requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act became effective on December 24, 2015. On August 23, 2016 Fannie Mae and Fannie Mac published the first material updates to the Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA) in more than 20 years which will become effective in 2018. These additions and updates have caused us to incur significant expense, and future updates will likely similarly cause us to incur significant expense. For example, if the new U.S. presidential administration and U.S. Congress significantly change or repeal the mortgage lending portions of the Dodd-Frank Act or the CFBP announces new rules or repeals previously announced rules, we may need to incur significant expense to make updates to our products and services. In addition, if our products and services fail to address relevant laws and regulations, we could be subject to claims by our customers that we have breached our customer contracts as well as potential claims by borrowers or government agencies. Such claims could result in substantial costs and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, if our products and services fail to address relevant laws and regulations this could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation and brand, hinder our ability to enroll new customers and cause us to lose current customers, all of which could substantially harm our business and operating results.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Potential structural changes in the U.S. residential mortgage industry, in particular plans to diminish the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could disrupt the residential mortgage market and have a material adverse effect on our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a very important role in providing liquidity, stability, and affordability in the current U.S. residential mortgage market. In particular, they participate in the secondary mortgage market by purchasing mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities for investment and by issuing guaranteed mortgage-related securities. There have been numerous executive branch proposals as well as proposed federal legislation which may wind down or recapitalize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and/or eliminate or reduce the government&#8217;s role in the housing market. Any significant structural change to the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or to the U.S. residential mortgage industry may cause significant disruption to the residential mortgage market. If we are unable to react effectively and quickly to changes in the residential mortgage industry or if such changes reduce the volume of mortgage lending, our business could be harmed.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">20</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We may be limited in the way in which we market our business or generate revenue by U.S. federal law prohibiting referral fees in real estate transactions, and if we are found to be in violation of such laws we would be subject to significant liability.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">RESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other thing of value for the referral of business related to a residential real estate settlement service and prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of such services. Encompass software and services and the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;were designed with payment methods that are intended to comply with the restrictions under RESPA. Nonetheless, RESPA may restrict our ability to enter into marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties for existing or newly developed products and services, particularly to the extent that such arrangements may be characterized as involving payments for the referral of residential real estate settlement service business. Additionally, any amendments to RESPA, court opinions interpreting the provisions of RESPA, or changes in the manner that RESPA is interpreted by the regulatory agencies responsible for enforcing RESPA, that result in restrictions on our current payment methods, or any determination that our payment methods have been and currently are subject to the restrictions under RESPA, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were found to be in violation of RESPA rules, we would be exposed to significant potential liability that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our business could be harmed.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, technical, finance, creative, and sales and marketing personnel. Moreover, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our named executive officers. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell, our solutions and harm the market&#8217;s perception of us. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing sales, operational and managerial requirements, or may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business will suffer.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Most of our named executive officers are vested in a substantial amount of stock options and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Performance Awards</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the vested options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock.

Some software providers, including </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Calyx Technology, Inc.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;and Black Knight Financial Services, Inc., also provide connectivity between their software users and lenders and service providers to make such services available to mortgage lenders. We also compete with compliance, document preparation service, and product eligibility and pricing service providers that are more established than us. There is vigorous competition among providers of these services and we may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services to switch to ours. In addition, some of our competitors are consolidating which facilitates greater cross-selling of services, which could weaken our ability to differentiate our offering in the market. Some of our competitors also offer services on a per closed loan basis, which could adversely impact the effectiveness of our </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Success Based Pricing</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;strategy for increasing the number of Encompass customers. If we are unsuccessful in competing effectively by providing attractive functionality, customer service or value, we could lose existing Encompass users to our competitors and our ability to attract new Encompass users could be harmed.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">There are many service providers that offer our Encompass users competing services, including borrower-facing websites, customer relationship management solutions, document preparation services, compliance services, product eligibility and pricing services, and electronic document management services.

The principal alternative to the use of the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;by Encompass users remains traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants by email, facsimile, phone, courier, and mail. In addition, mortgage originators may use standalone web browsers to go individually to each investor, lender or service provider&#8217;s website, and then manually upload loan data or enter information into the website. Mortgage originators may continue to use these methods due to habit, personal business relationships or otherwise. The success of the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;depends on our ability to achieve and offer access to both the critical mass of investors, lenders, and service providers necessary to attract and retain mortgage originators using Encompass on the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;and the critical mass of active mortgage originators necessary to attract and retain investors, lenders, and service providers on our network.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Some of our actual and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do and, as a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to changes in regulations, new technologies or customer demands, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their software and services than we can. In addition, we may face increased competition as a result of continuing industry consolidation. We expect the mortgage origination market to continue to attract new competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face will not materially adversely affect our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Failure to adapt to technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our solutions to our customers.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:30px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">If new industry standards and practices emerge, or if competitors introduce new solutions embodying new services or technologies, Encompass and the </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;technology may become obsolete.

We can give no assurance that the outcome of any such matter would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes or the actual impact of these matters on our profitability at this time, and any views we form as to the viability of these claims or the financial exposure in which they could result, could change from time to time as the matters proceed through their course, as facts are established, and various judicial determinations are made.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">If we agree to settle these matters or judgments are secured against us, we may incur charges which may have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and future prospects.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The protection of our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary Encompass software and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;technology, is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret law, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee any patents will be issued to us as a result of our patent applications. We also rely in part on confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, independent contractors, and consultants. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Ellie Mae Network</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;and Encompass features and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.

Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the terms Ellie Mae, Encompass or our other trademarks.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our patent and copyright rights, trade secrets and domain names, and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Assertions that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Other parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. In addition, we generally agree to indemnify our customers against legal claims that our software products infringe intellectual property rights of third parties and, in the event of an infringement, to modify or replace the infringing product or, if those options are not reasonably possible, to refund the cost of the software, as pro-rated over a period of years. We cannot predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend against any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees if the infringement were found to be willful; cease providing solutions that allegedly incorporate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign or re-engineer our solutions and products, if feasible; and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. We cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation. Any royalty or licensing agreement, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale or distribution of some of our products and services and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our internal information technology systems are critical to our business.&#160;System integration and implementation issues could disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business or results in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, including systems for customer billing, human resources, enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management.&#160; As our business has grown in size and complexity, the growth has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our internal information technology systems. To effectively manage this growth, we must commit significant financial resources and personnel to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or acquire new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in our business and information processing technology as well as evolving industry, regulatory and accounting standards. &#160;If the information we rely upon to run our businesses is determined to be inaccurate or unreliable, if we fail to properly maintain or enhance our internal information technology systems, we could have operational disruptions, customer disputes, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls, have increases in operating and administrative expenses, lose our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or suffer other adverse consequences.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies, and ultimately have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As a publicly-traded company, we are subject to compliance with, among other regulations, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, which requires that we test our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our compliance with SOX requires that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange, regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions, and class action litigation.</font></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align:center;"><div style="line-height:120%;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">23</font></div></div><hr style="page-break-after:always"><div><br></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As a third-party technology service provider of mission-critical products and services to many financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC, we are subject to an IT examination by the member agencies of the FFIEC. As a result, the FFIEC conducts recurring IT Examinations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to whom we provide products and services, evaluate our risk management systems, and controls and determine our compliance with applicable laws that affect the&#160;products and&#160;services we provide to financial institutions. In addition to examining areas such as our management of technology, data integrity, information confidentiality, and service availability, the reviews also assess our financial stability. In June 2014, the FDIC, a member agency of the FFIEC, completed its IT examination, and found that, while the services we provide to our client banks are satisfactory,&#160;several matters required further attention, some of which were repeat findings and recommendations from the FDIC&#8217;s 2012 examination. Although management has developed a plan for addressing these matters, we cannot be assured that the plan will satisfy the FDIC or applicable law. A sufficiently unfavorable review from the FFIEC in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">If one or more U.S. states or local jurisdictions successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect additional sales or use taxes on our fees, we could be subject to additional liability with respect to past or future sales, and the results of our operations could be adversely affected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">We do not collect state and local sales and use taxes on all sales in all jurisdictions in which our customers are located, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use tax laws and rates vary by jurisdiction and such laws are subject to interpretation. Jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales and use taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in the assessment of such taxes, interest, and penalties, and we could be required to collect such taxes in the future. This additional sales and use tax liability could adversely affect the results of our operations.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods, and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our corporate offices and one of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas with higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our or our customers&#8217; businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting the San Francisco Bay Area, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.

Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities.

A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, the adoption of ASC 606, a new revenue recognition standard which becomes effective in fiscal 2018, could impact the timing of recognition of certain revenue streams, as well as how we account for certain commissions. Further, the evaluation and implementation of new standards, including ASC 606, may require additional resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:12px;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:6px;text-align:justify;text-indent:32px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Our board of directors previously approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $75.0 million of our common stock over a 36-month period ending in May 2017, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">$42.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#32;of which remains available as of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">December&#160;31, 2016</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.

There can be no assurance that we will repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on the trading price of our common stock or earnings per share. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time, the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, the availability of adequate funds, and our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program.
