Use of our platform involves the storage, transmission and processing of our subscribers&#8217; proprietary data, including personal or identifying information regarding their consumers or employees.&#160;&#160;Unauthorized access to or security breaches of our platform could result in the loss of data, loss of intellectual property or trade secrets, loss of business, reputational damage, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, and significant fees and other monetary payments for remediation.&#160;&#160;If any unauthorized access to our systems or data or any other security breach occurs, or is believed to have occurred, our reputation and brand could be damaged, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such actual or perceived breaches and remediate our systems, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability, some or all of which may not be covered by insurance, and our ability to operate our business may be impaired.&#160;&#160;If subscribers believe that our platform does not provide adequate security for the storage of personally identifiable or other sensitive information or its transmission over the Internet, our business will be harmed.&#160;&#160;Subscribers&#8217; concerns about security, privacy, or data protection may deter them from using our platform for activities that involve personal or other sensitive information.&#160;&#160;Additionally, actual, potential or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants.&#160;&#160;Our errors and omissions insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses may not be sufficient to compensate for all potential liability.&#160;&#160;Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.&#160;&#160;We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for extended periods of time.Because data security is a critical competitive factor in our industry, we make statements in our privacy policies and terms of service, through our certifications to privacy standards, and in our marketing materials, describing the security of our platform, including descriptions of certain security measures we employ.&#160;&#160;Should any of these statements be untrue, become untrue, or be perceived to be untrue, even if through circumstances beyond our reasonable control, we may face claims, including claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, state, local or foreign regulators or private litigants.15Table of Contents

Personal privacy, information security, and data protection are significant issues in the United States, Europe and many other jurisdictions where we offer our platform.&#160;&#160;The regulatory framework for privacy, security, and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and the Federal Trade Commission and numerous state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use and dissemination of personally identifiable information and other data.&#160;&#160;Some of these requirements include obligations on companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or our service providers.&#160;&#160;Even though we may have contractual protections with our service providers, notifications related to a security breach could impact our reputation, harm customer confidence, hurt our sales and expansion into new markets or cause us to lose existing customers.Further, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and Canada, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction.&#160;&#160;Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data that identifies or may be used to identify or locate an individual, such as names, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses.&#160;These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States and, at least with respect to the European Union, remain in flux.&#160;&#160;For example, with regard to data transfers of personal data from our European employees and customers to the United States, we have historically relied on our adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, which established means for legitimizing the transfer of personal data by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the United States.  In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework.  In July 2016, the European Union and the United States announced the adoption of a new framework for legitimizing trans-Atlantic data flows, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.  In September 2016, we self-certified with the U.S. Department of Commerce under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a replacement to the now invalid EU-U.S. Safe Harbor Framework. Notwithstanding this certification, uncertainty remains as to whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and other legal mechanisms for the lawful transfer of data from the European Union to the United States will withstand legal challenges, whether from national regulators or private parties. If our privacy and data policies and practices, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient or if our customers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States, customer demand for our platform could decline and our business could be negatively impacted.We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.&#160;&#160;For example, in April 2016, the EU Parliament adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which, among other things, imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance and is expected to take effect in May 2018.&#160;&#160;Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our or our subscribers&#8217; ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our platform, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our subscriber base and increase our revenue.&#160;&#160;New laws (including, among others, the GDPR), amendments to or re-interpretations of existing laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other obligations may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations.&#160;&#160;In view of new or modified federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations, or any changes in their interpretation, we may find it necessary or desirable to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our software or platform and otherwise adapt to these changes.&#160;&#160;Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our subscribers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.&#160;&#160;We may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and our ability to develop new products and features could be limited.&#160;&#160;Moreover, following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the European Union, it is expected that the U.K. government will initiate a process to leave the European Union.&#160;&#160;The impact of the foregoing on data and privacy regulations in the United Kingdom remains uncertain. Any of these developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our subscribers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform.&#160;&#160;Privacy, information security, and data protection concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.16Table of Contents

As a service provider to our subscribers, we must comply with a number of data protection, security, privacy and other government- and industry-specific requirements, including those that require companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data.&#160;&#160;For example, our solutions must conform, in certain circumstances, to requirements set forth in HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which collectively govern the privacy and security of protected health information.&#160;&#160;Through the provision of online scheduling services to certain of our clients, we may collect, access, use, maintain and transmit protected health information in ways that may be subject to certain of these laws and regulations.&#160;&#160;Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.HIPAA applies to covered entities (e.g., health plans, health care clearinghouses and most health care providers) and to &#8220;business associates&#8221; of covered entities, which include individuals and entities that provide services for or on behalf of covered entities pursuant to which the service providers may access protected health information, as well as subcontractors of business associates who may access such information.&#160;&#160;Because certain subscribers that are HIPAA-covered entities or HIPAA-business associates may receive and transmit protected health information through our platform, we may be considered to be a business associate or a subcontractor to business associates with respect to these subscribers.&#160;&#160;Therefore, under the current HIPAA regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, if we experience a breach of patient information, the liability rules for business associates and business associates&#8217; subcontractors could result in substantial financial and reputational harm to our business.The Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or Privacy Rule, and the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, or Security Rule, which jointly govern the privacy and security of protected health information, could significantly affect our business.&#160;&#160;The Privacy Rule&#160;and the Security Rule&#160;require the development and implementation of policies, procedures and contracts to assure compliance.&#160;&#160;We have implemented certain compliance measures, but we may be required to make additional modifications or to document and implement additional policies and procedures to comply with evolving HIPAA rules and our subscribers&#8217; business associate agreements with us.&#160;&#160;We may also be required to perform periodic audits and refinements as required by HIPAA and our subscribers&#8217; business associate agreements with us.Additionally, because we process a significant portion of our payments through debit or credit cards and enable our subscribers to engage in payments through our service, we are contractually required to maintain Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI DSS, compliance as part of our information security program.&#160;&#160;We also may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other privacy, security, or data protection-related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to privacy, information security, and data protection.&#160;&#160;We also may be bound by additional, more stringent contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data.&#160;&#160;If we cannot comply with or if we incur a violation of any of these regulations or requirements, we could incur significant liability through fines and penalties imposed by credit card associations or other organizations, breach of contracts with our payment processors, or our growth could be adversely impacted, either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.17Table of Contents

Our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential subscribers to access our platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time.&#160;&#160;Our platform is proprietary, and we rely on the expertise of members of our engineering, operations and software development teams for our platform's continued performance.&#160;&#160;We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, denial-of-service attacks, or other security related incidents.&#160;&#160;For example, in 2011, we were subject to a denial-of-service attack that rendered our core software inaccessible for several hours.&#160;&#160;In addition, from time to time we experience limited periods of server downtime due to server failure or other technical difficulties.&#160;&#160;In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time.&#160;&#160;It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more complex and our user traffic increases due to, among other things, a growing number of subscribers and consumers originating from and demanding service in a greater number of countries.&#160;&#160;If our platform is unavailable or if our users are unable to access our platform within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, our business would be adversely affected and our brand could be harmed.&#160;&#160;In the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our infrastructure, subscriber or consumer data may be permanently lost.&#160;&#160;Moreover, our agreements with subscribers typically provide for a limited warranty relating to service level commitments.  Our subscribers may be eligible for credits if we are unable to meet these service level commitments.&#160;&#160;If we experience significant periods of service downtime in the future, we may be subject to claims by our subscribers against these warranties.&#160;&#160;To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.
CONTENT_11:
Because our platform is complex, undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may occur, especially when updates are deployed or if there are issues with our secure access management procedures.&#160;&#160;Our platform is often used in connection with computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors in or failures of our platform or other aspects of the computing environments.&#160;&#160;In addition, deployment of our platform into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose undetected errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our platform.&#160;&#160;Despite testing by us, errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may not be found in our platform until after it is deployed to our subscribers or their consumers.&#160;&#160;We have discovered, and expect to discover in the future, software errors, failures, vulnerabilities and bugs in our platform, and we anticipate that certain of these errors, failures, vulnerabilities and bugs will only be discovered and remediated after deployment to subscribers.&#160;&#160;Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position or claims by subscribers for losses sustained by them.&#160;&#160;In such an event, we may be required, or may choose for subscriber relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem and or repair goodwill with our subscribers.

We may suffer an attack on our payments platform that results in a breach of consumer cardholder data.&#160;&#160;We maintain payment information for tens of millions of consumers on our payments platform, and we are a potential target for hackers and other parties attempting to steal credit card data via cyber-attacks or other means.&#160;&#160;As we increase our consumer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for these malicious third parties.&#160;&#160;If we experience any actual or perceived data breach as a result of third-party actions, employee negligence or error, or malfeasance, whether or not resulting in the unauthorized acquisition of or access to cardholder data, we could incur significant liability, our business may suffer and our brand and reputation may be damaged.&#160;&#160;We could be required to pay extensive fines and costs related to any such data breach, including costs incurred to replace credit cards and cardholder information and provide security monitoring services, and we could lose future sales and subscribers, any of which could harm our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;Such fines and costs could become due in one or two business days following such breach and exceed the amount of cash available to us, thereby impacting our ability to operate our business.&#160;&#160;In addition, a data breach or failure to comply with rules or regulations of payment systems could also result in the termination of our status as a registered Independent Sales Organization / Merchant Service Provider, thereby dramatically impairing our ability to continue doing business in the payments industry.
CONTENT_15:
We depend on our third-party processing partners to perform payment processing services.&#160;&#160;Our processing partners may go out of business or otherwise be unable or unwilling to continue providing such services, which could significantly and materially reduce our payments revenue and disrupt our business.&#160;&#160;A number of our processing contracts require us to assume liability for any losses our processing partners may suffer as a result of losses caused by our subscribers, including losses caused by chargebacks and consumer or subscriber fraud.&#160;&#160;We have in the past and may in the future incur losses caused by chargebacks and fraud.&#160;&#160;In the event of a significant loss by our processing partners, we may be required to remit a large amount of cash in one or two business days following such event and, if we do not have sufficient cash on hand, may be deemed in breach of such contracts.&#160;&#160;In addition, our subscribers may be subject to quality issues related to products or services provided by our third-party processing partners or we may become involved in contractual disputes with our processing partners both of which could impact our reputation and adversely impact our revenue.&#160;&#160;Certain contracts may expire or be terminated, and we may not be able to replicate the associated revenue through a new processing partner relationship for a considerable period of time.We expect to initiate new third-party payment relationships or migrate to other third-party payment partners in the future.&#160;&#160;The initiation of these relationships and the transition from one relationship to another would require significant time and resources.&#160;&#160;New third-party payment processing relationships may not be as effective, efficient or well received by subscribers and their consumers, nor is there any assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with such processing partners.&#160;&#160;Our contracts with such processing partners may be less lucrative.&#160;&#160;For instance, we may be required to pay more for payment processing or receive a less favorable revenue arrangement from our payment processing partners.&#160;&#160;We may also experience the termination of revenue streams due to such migrations.19Table of Contents
CONTENT_16:
In the future, we may undertake to directly perform certain payment processing services that we currently depend upon our processing partners to perform, expand the scope of payment processing services we provide, offer additional payment processing services or otherwise undertake additional responsibilities and liabilities related to such payment processing services.&#160;&#160;For example, in the future, we may undertake to act as a registered payment facilitator or payment service provider of the payment systems, providing merchants with a suite of services, including payment processing and funding and accepting payments as the merchant of record on behalf of other merchants.&#160;&#160;Any of these endeavors would require a significant investment of time and effective management of resources before presenting any potential upside for us, and may dramatically expand the scope of our potential contractual liability or exposure in the event of a lawsuit.&#160;&#160;Further, we may fail to effectively execute in performing such an expansion of services.
CONTENT_17:
We have from time to time, increased the price of our software subscriptions, and may do so again in the future. For example, multiple times over the past three years, including most recently in January 2017, we increased pricing for one or more of our monthly subscription tiers, which we believe may have reduced the number of new subscribers adopting our software and may reduce the retention of existing subscribers.  In the future, we may be required to refine our software tiers or customers may migrate to lower tier offerings or leave our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our subscriber numbers, revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position and cash flow.

The market for business management software for the wellness services industry is fragmented and rapidly evolving, with relatively low barriers to entry.&#160;&#160;We face competition from in-house developed software systems, other software companies, and traditional paper-based methods.&#160;&#160;Our competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the products and services they offer.&#160;&#160;In addition, there are a number of companies that are not currently direct competitors but that could in the future shift their focus to the wellness services industry and offer competing products and services.&#160;&#160;Some of these companies, such as Intuit and Square, have or may in the future acquire greater financial and other resources than we do and could bundle competing products and services with their other offerings or offer such products and services at lower prices as part of a larger sale.&#160;&#160;There is also a risk that certain of our current business partners could terminate their relationships with us and use the insights they have gained from partnering with us to introduce their own competing products.&#160;&#160;Many of our current and potential competitors have greater name recognition, established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and pre-existing relationships with customers, consultants, system integrators and resellers.&#160;&#160;Additionally, some potential subscribers in the wellness services industry, particularly large organizations, have elected, and may in the future elect, to develop their own business management software.&#160;&#160;Certain of our competitors have partnered with, or have acquired, and may in the future partner with or acquire, or be acquired by, other competitors to offer services, leveraging their collective competitive positions, which makes, or would make, it more difficult to compete with them.Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.&#160;&#160;With the introduction of new technologies, the evolution of our platform and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.&#160;&#160;Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, increased churn, reduced subscriber retention, further losses or the failure of our platform to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.&#160;&#160;For all of these reasons, we may fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, and if such failure occurs, our business will be harmed.20Table of Contents

Increasing our subscriber base and achieving broader market acceptance of our platform will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities, including internationally.&#160;&#160;We are substantially dependent on our marketing organization to generate a sufficient pipeline of qualified sales leads and on our direct sales force to close new subscribers.&#160;&#160;From December&#160;31, 2015&#32;to December&#160;31, 2016, our sales and marketing organizations increased from 422&#32;to 493&#32;employees.&#160;&#160;We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally, and to increase the number of our sales professionals who have experience in selling to larger organizations.&#160;&#160;We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require, and this competition is particularly acute for us given that our headquarters is located in San Luis Obispo, a small city with fewer resources than the San Francisco Bay Area, where many companies competing for similar talent are based.&#160;&#160;Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals.&#160;&#160;New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories.&#160;&#160;Our recent and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business.&#160;&#160;We cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales force or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive.&#160; If our marketing organization does not generate a sufficient pipeline of qualified sales leads and our direct sales force is unable to close subscribers, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.
CONTENT_20:
The market for our platform is highly fragmented.&#160;&#160;As a result, even if this market grows as expected, our ability to achieve long-term revenue growth will largely depend on our sales team&#8217;s ability to sell subscriptions to a large number of new small and medium-sized businesses on a consistent basis, with each sale constituting only a small portion of our overall revenue.&#160;&#160;To achieve this type of subscriber growth in a cost-effective manner, it is crucial that our platform is easy to use and implement without the need for excessive post-sale customer support.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to sell a large volume of subscriptions on a consistent basis, or if we are forced to incur excessive costs to provide post-sale customer support, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects will be adversely affected.
CONTENT_21:
In deploying and using our platform, our subscribers depend on our 24/7 customer support team to resolve complex technical and operational issues, including ensuring that our platform is implemented in a manner that integrates with a variety of third-party platforms.&#160;&#160;We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in subscriber demand for customer support.&#160;&#160;We also may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of our customer support to compete with changes in customer support services provided by our competitors.&#160;&#160;Increased subscriber demand for customer support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results.&#160;&#160;Our sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing subscribers.&#160;&#160;Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, our ability to sell our platform to existing and prospective subscribers, our business, operating results and financial position.

Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.&#160;&#160;If our quarterly financial results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our Class&#160;A common stock could decline substantially.&#160;&#160;Some of the important factors that may cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:&#8226;our ability to attract new subscribers, retain and increase sales to existing subscribers and satisfy our subscribers&#8217; requirements;&#8226;the mix of our subscriber base;&#8226;the volume of transactions processed on our payments platform;&#8226;the variability of revenues derived from our partners;21Table of Contents&#8226;the number of new employees added;&#8226;the rate of expansion and productivity of our sales force;&#8226;the entrance of new competitors in our market, whether by established companies or new companies;&#8226;changes in our or our competitors&#8217; pricing policies;&#8226;the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our business, including our sales force;&#8226;new pricing models, products, features or functionalities introduced by our competitors;&#8226;significant security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions to our platform and any related impact on our reputation;&#8226;the timing of payments by subscribers and other payment processing partners and payment defaults by subscribers or other payment processing partners;&#8226;litigation, including class action litigation, involving our company, our services or our industry;&#8226;general economic conditions or declines in consumer interest in the wellness industries that we serve, either of which may adversely affect either our subscribers&#8217; ability or willingness to purchase additional subscriptions, delay a prospective subscriber&#8217;s purchasing decision, reduce the value of new subscription contracts or affect subscriber retention;&#8226;changes in the relative and absolute levels of customer support we provide;&#8226;changes in foreign currency exchange rates;&#8226;extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;&#8226;the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and&#8226;the timing of the grant or vesting of equity awards to employees.Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, operating results and cash flows to vary widely.  As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue, operating results and cash flows may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.

We have experienced rapid growth in our operations and headcount, which has placed, and future growth may continue to place, significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure.&#160;&#160;Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively.&#160;&#160;To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to scale our technology infrastructure and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures.&#160;&#160;Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in onboarding new subscribers, declines in quality or subscriber satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties.&#160;&#160;Any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and operating results.

We believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity and teamwork.&#160;&#160;However, as our organization grows, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of such culture, and the failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to retain and attract the kind of employees necessary for our future success.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to manage our anticipated growth and change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our culture, the quality of our products and services may suffer, which could adversely affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract subscribers.22Table of Contents

Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees, including our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Stollmeyer.&#160;&#160;We rely on our leadership team in the areas of research and development, operations, security, marketing, sales, support, general and administrative functions, and on individual contributors in our research and development and operations.&#160;&#160;We have experienced, and may in the future experience, changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business.&#160;&#160;We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period, and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time.&#160;&#160;The loss of one or more of our executive officers, especially our Chief Executive Officer, or other key employees, could have an adverse effect on our business.In addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel.&#160;&#160;Competition for these personnel in the locations where we maintain offices is intense, especially in the San Luis Obispo area, where our headquarters is located, due in part to the relatively close proximity to the San Francisco Bay Area.&#160;&#160;We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications.&#160;&#160;In some cases, we have recruited employees from the San Francisco Bay Area and other regions with a greater supply of managerial, sales and engineering talent, and in such cases, we have sometimes found it necessary to offer compensation packages that were larger than would have been necessary if no relocation had been required.&#160;&#160;Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are located in areas in which sales and engineering talent is more readily available.&#160;&#160;Moreover, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment.&#160;&#160;If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees may be adversely impacted.&#160;&#160;If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.&#160;&#160;

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a differentiated and category-defining business management software company serving the wellness services industry is critical to our relationship with our existing subscribers and to our ability to attract new subscribers.&#160;&#160;The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality software, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services.The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we seek to expand our platform.&#160;&#160;To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur.&#160;&#160;If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose subscribers or fail to attract potential subscribers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our subscribers.&#160;&#160;The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for business management software generally and for business management software serving the wellness services industry in particular.&#160;&#160;Historically, during economic downturns, there have been reductions in spending on information technology as well as pressure for extended billing terms and other financial concessions.&#160;&#160;The adverse impact of economic downturns may be particularly acute among small and medium-sized businesses, which comprise the vast majority of our subscriber base.&#160;&#160;If economic conditions deteriorate, our current and prospective subscribers may elect to decrease their information technology budgets, which would limit our ability to grow our business and adversely affect our operating results.23Table of Contents

It is difficult to predict adoption rates, demand for our platform, the growth of our addressable market, the entry of competitive products or services or the success of existing competitive products or services.&#160;&#160;Any expansion in this market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with our platform.&#160;&#160;If growth in the market and the adoption rates for our platform do not grow as expected, and as a result we are unable to increase the sales of subscriptions to our platforms, then our revenues could decline and our operating results would be harmed.

We plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle.&#160;&#160;These assumptions are based upon historical trends for sales cycles and conversion rates associated with our existing subscribers, many of whom to date have been small to medium-sized organizations.&#160;&#160;As we expand our sales efforts to include larger organizations, we expect to incur higher costs and longer and more unpredictable sales cycles.&#160;&#160;With larger organizations, the decision to subscribe to our platform may require the approval of more technical personnel and management levels within a potential subscriber&#8217;s organization than we have historically encountered, and if so, these types of sales would require us to invest more time educating these potential subscribers.&#160;&#160;In addition, larger organizations may demand more features and integration and customer support services.&#160;&#160;We have limited experience in developing and managing sales strategies for larger organizations and in successfully onboarding larger organizations as new subscribers.&#160;&#160;As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may not prove to be successful or may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, customer support and professional services resources to individual subscribers, resulting in increased costs and reduced profitability, and will likely lengthen our typical sales cycle, which could strain our resources.&#160;&#160;Moreover, these larger transactions may require us to delay recognizing the associated revenue we derive from these subscribers until any technical or implementation requirements have been met, and larger subscribers may demand discounts to the prices they pay for our platform.&#160;&#160;Other factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:&#8226;our pricing terms;&#8226;the need to educate prospective subscribers about the uses and benefits of our platform;&#8226;the discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;&#8226;the competitive nature of evaluation and purchasing processes;&#8226;evolving functionality demands;&#8226;announcements or planned introductions of new products, features or functionality by us or our competitors; and&#8226;lengthy purchasing approval processes, particularly among larger organizations.If we are unsuccessful expanding sales to larger organizations, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, if we are unable to close one or more expected significant transactions with subscribers in a particular period, or if one or more expected transactions are delayed until a subsequent period, our operating results for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transactions would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected.

We depend on our partner ecosystem to create apps that will integrate with our platform.&#160;&#160;This presents certain risks to our business, including:&#8226;these apps may not meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts (including, among other things, data and privacy protections), and to the extent they contain bugs or defects, they may create disruptions in our subscribers&#8217; use of our platform or adversely affect our brand;&#8226;these apps are subject to removal from third party distribution platforms, including Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play, among others;&#8226;we do not currently provide substantive support for software apps developed by our partner ecosystem, and users may be left without adequate support and potentially cease using our platform if our partners do not provide adequate support for these apps;&#8226;our partners may not possess the appropriate intellectual property rights to develop and share their apps;24Table of Contents&#8226;our relationship with our partners may change, which could adversely affect our revenue and our results of operations;&#8226;our revenues from technology and API partners have grown rapidly in recent periods and, if our relationship with partners who contribute or have contributed more significantly to this growth or demand for products or services of these partners changes, this could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations;&#8226;some of our partners may use the insight they gain from integrating with our software and from information publicly available to develop competing products or product features; and&#8226;our partners may establish relationships with, or functionality to offer to, our subscribers that diminish or eliminate the need or desire for our API platform.Many of these risks are not within our control to prevent, and our brand may be damaged if these apps do not perform to our users&#8217; satisfaction and that dissatisfaction is attributed to us.

We estimate that over 30 million&#32;active consumers used our platform during the two years ended December&#160;31, 2016.&#160;While we do not directly monetize consumers of our subscribers&#8217; services, we believe that growth in the number of active consumers on our platform also contributes to our subscriber growth.&#160;&#160;In calculating this number, we have attempted to avoid duplicative counting of consumers by identifying consumers who may have used our platform through different subscribers.&#160;&#160;However, in certain cases, a single consumer may have transacted with multiple subscribers under slightly different names, in which case there is a chance that we have counted the same consumer more than once.&#160;&#160;Given the challenges inherent in identifying whether a single consumer has engaged in transactions on our platform under different names, we do not have a reliable way of identifying the precise number of consumers using our platform.&#160;&#160;If the number of actual consumers is materially lower than our expectations, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, which could harm our operating and financial results and cause our stock price to decline.

In the years ended December 31, 2016&#32;and 2015, we derived 17%&#32;and 16%, respectively, of our revenue from subscribers located outside of the United States. We are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy.&#160;&#160;We currently have sales personnel and sales and customer support operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.&#160;&#160;Our sales organization outside the United States is substantially smaller than our sales organization in the United States.&#160;&#160;We believe our ability to convince new subscribers to subscribe to our platform or to convince existing subscribers to renew or expand their use of our platform is directly correlated to the level of engagement we obtain with the subscriber.&#160;&#160;To the extent we are unable to effectively engage with non-U.S. subscribers due to our limited sales force capacity, we may be unable to effectively grow in international markets.Our international operations subject us to a variety of additional risks and challenges, including:&#8226;increased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;&#8226;compliance with foreign privacy, information security, and data protection laws and regulations and the risks and costs of non-compliance;&#8226;longer payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivable or satisfying revenue recognition criteria, especially in emerging markets;&#8226;increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;&#8226;uncertainty regarding the expected departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union;&#8226;requirements or preferences for domestic products;&#8226;differing technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;&#8226;economic conditions in each country or region and general economic uncertainty around the world;&#8226;compliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. Travel Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act 25Table of Contents2010), import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our platform in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;&#8226;heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements;&#8226;fluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effect on our operating results;&#8226;difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;&#8226;communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures and political systems;&#8226;differing labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries;&#8226;the need for localized software and licensing programs;&#8226;the need for localized language support;&#8226;reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad; and&#8226;compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes.Any of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our international revenue or increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, operating results, financial condition and growth prospects.Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations substantially increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;We may be unable to keep current with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time.&#160;&#160;Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business.&#160;&#160;In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. or other regulations applicable to us.&#160;&#160;Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies.&#160;&#160;Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, partners, or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, other collateral consequences, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our platform and services and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#160;201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities.&#160;&#160;Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector.&#160;&#160;We use third-party representatives to sell our products and services abroad.&#160;&#160;In addition, as we increase our international sales and business, we may engage with additional business partners and third-party intermediaries to sell our products and services abroad and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals.&#160;&#160;We or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities.&#160;&#160;We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.26Table of ContentsNoncompliance with anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences.&#160;&#160;If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.&#160;&#160;In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.&#160;&#160;Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others.&#160;&#160;We believe this variability is largely due to our focus on the wellness services industry, as many of our subscribers experience an increase in demand for their services in the first quarter of each year due to their consumers becoming more motivated to pursue health and fitness goals in the new year.&#160;&#160;Our rapid growth rate over the last couple years may have made seasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect.&#160;&#160;If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.

We depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships in order to sustain and grow our business.&#160;&#160;We are highly dependent upon partners for certain critical features and functionality of our platform, including data centers and third-party payment processors supporting our payments platform.&#160;&#160;Failure of these or any other technology provider to maintain, support or secure its technology platforms in general, and our integrations in particular, or errors or defects in its technology, could materially and adversely impact our relationship with our subscribers, damage our reputation and brand, and harm our business and operating results.&#160;&#160;Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays or difficulties in our ability to provide our platform until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, identified, obtained and integrated.Identifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with strategic third parties such as API platform partners, payments partners and technology partners requires significant time and resources.&#160;&#160;In addition, integrating third-party technology is complex, costly and time-consuming.&#160;&#160;Our agreements with partners are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services.&#160;&#160;Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our platform.&#160;&#160;In addition, our partners could develop competing products or services.Our third-party partners may also suffer disruptions or weakness in their businesses unrelated to the relationships with us that could cause declines in their business performance.  Such occurrences could be harmful to our financial results and cause our stock price to decline.If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these strategic third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.&#160;&#160;Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in improved operating results.

Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property.&#160;&#160;We currently have thirteen pending patent applications, but there is no guarantee that such applications will result in issued patents.&#160;&#160;We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, subscribers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights.&#160;&#160;However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate.To protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights.&#160;&#160;Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property.&#160;&#160;Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights.&#160;&#160;Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.29Table of Contents

We have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings, loan facilities, financing agreements for software and license maintenance and subscription payments by our subscribers for use of our platform.&#160;&#160;In the future, we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, and we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, and a decline in the level of subscriptions for our platform or unforeseen circumstances.&#160;&#160;We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all.&#160;&#160;Any debt financing obtained by us could involve restrictive covenants relating to financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions.&#160;&#160;If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class&#160;A common stock.&#160;&#160;If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.

Borrowings under our loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank are secured by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.&#160;&#160;In addition, borrowings under our loan agreement are based on a percentage of our monthly recurring revenue for the prior months, up to $20 million.&#160;&#160;If our revenue declines, our ability to draw under the loan agreement could be adversely affected or if we were to draw under the loan agreement, a decline in our revenue could force us to repay all or a portion of the outstanding loan earlier than we may have originally anticipated.Our loan agreement also restricts our ability to, among other things:&#8226;sell or otherwise dispose of our assets;&#8226;make material changes in our business;&#8226;enter into a transaction in which stockholders who were not stockholders immediately prior to such transaction own more than 40% of our voting stock after giving effect to such transaction;&#8226;consolidate, merge with, or acquire other entities;&#8226;incur additional indebtedness;&#8226;create liens on our assets;&#8226;pay dividends or make other distributions on our capital stock;&#8226;make investments;&#8226;enter into transactions with affiliates; and&#8226;pay off or redeem subordinated indebtedness.These restrictions are subject to certain exceptions.&#160;&#160;In addition, our loan agreement requires us to maintain a certain percentage of our projected revenue.&#160;&#160;The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the loan agreement, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, could restrict our ability to finance our operations and to engage in, expand or otherwise pursue business activities and strategies that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial.&#160;&#160;Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and future breaches of any of these covenants could result in a default under the loan agreement.The loan agreement also contains customary events of default, subject to cure periods for certain defaults, including, among others, payment defaults, covenant defaults, the occurrence of a material adverse change in our business, defaults relating to certain legal processes affecting our assets or business, insolvency and bankruptcy defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, material judgment defaults, and material misrepresentations.&#160;&#160;Future defaults, if not waived, could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreement to become immediately due and payable and would permit Silicon Valley Bank to terminate all commitments to extend further credit and exercise remedies against the collateral in which we granted Silicon Valley Bank a security interest.30Table of ContentsIf we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.&#160;&#160;This could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.

Our independent registered accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal controls over financial reporting. However, in connection with past audits of our consolidated financial statements, we identified a material weakness in the design of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.&#160;&#160;A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.&#160;&#160;In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December&#160;31, 2014, we identified a material weakness related to the inadequate design and implementation of controls and procedures with respect to the identification of and evaluation of accounting for certain features, including the related fair value computation and accounting for transactions related to our redeemable convertible preferred stock.&#160;&#160;The material weakness from our 2014 audit was related to the control over the accounting for certain features of and transactions related to our redeemable convertible preferred stock. Immediately prior to the completion of our initial public offering, all shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were automatically converted and reclassified into shares of Class&#160;B common stock. As a result, we are no longer subject to the accounting rules that gave rise to the material weakness and the related controls are no longer applicable.  Moreover, as a result of the identification of this material weakness, we have implemented measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting.  Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future.&#160;&#160;If other material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.&#160;&#160;As a result of such failures, we could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, and become subject to litigation from investors and stockholders, which could harm our reputation, financial condition or divert financial and management resources from our core business.

We conduct transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.&#160;&#160;While we have primarily transacted with subscribers and vendors in U.S. dollars, we have transacted in foreign currencies for subscriptions to our platform and expect to significantly expand the number of transactions with subscribers for our platform that are denominated in foreign currencies in the future.&#160;&#160;As a result of such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could be more difficult to detect underlying trends in our business and results of operations.&#160;&#160;In addition, to the extent that fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including, any fluctuations resulting from uncertainties relating to the expected departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations or the expectations of our investors, the trading price of our Class&#160;A common stock could be adversely affected.We do not currently maintain a program to hedge transactional exposures in foreign currencies.&#160;&#160;However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.&#160;&#160;The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.&#160;&#160;Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.

We are subject to federal and state income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, and such laws and rates vary by jurisdiction.&#160;&#160;We do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable.&#160;&#160;Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future.31Table of ContentsSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.&#160;&#160;We generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.&#160;&#160;These determinations are highly complex and require detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials.&#160;&#160;In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.Although we believe our tax practices and provisions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we unilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, there could be a material effect on our tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made, which could materially impact our financial results.&#160;&#160;Further, any changes in the taxation of our activities, including certain proposed changes in U.S. tax laws, may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.&#160;&#160;In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period.&#160;&#160;Therefore, we may be subject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.

As of December&#160;31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $103.0 million&#32;and $88.9 million, respectively, due to prior period losses, which, subject to the following discussion, are generally available to be carried forward to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire.  Our federal NOLs begin to expire in the year ending December&#160;31, 2025, and our state NOLs started to expire in 2016 for the earliest net operating loss layers.  In general, under Section&#160;382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income.&#160;&#160;Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed an analysis under Section 382 of the Code through December 31, 2014, and determined that we experienced multiple ownership changes during this period which will limit future utilization of NOL carryforwards.  U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $430,000 are expected to expire due to limitations under Section 382 and, as such, have not been reflected in the NOL carryforward above. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code.  Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations.&#160;&#160;There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.&#160;&#160;For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we attain profitability

Stockholders who held shares of our Class&#160;B common stock as of December 31, 2016, including, among others, our executive officers, employees and directors and their respective affiliates, collectively held approximately 76.0% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of such date.&#160;&#160;Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class&#160;B common stock and Class&#160;A common stock, the holders of our Class&#160;B common stock will collectively continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of our Class&#160;B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class&#160;A common stock and Class&#160;B common stock.&#160;&#160;These holders of our Class&#160;B common stock may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests.&#160;&#160;This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class&#160;A common stock.Future transfers by holders of our Class&#160;B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class&#160;A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for tax or estate planning purposes.&#160;&#160;The conversion of shares of our Class&#160;B common stock into shares of our Class&#160;A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class&#160;B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. Significant individual holders of our Class B common stock include our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard Stollmeyer.&#160;&#160;If, for example, Mr. Stollmeyer retains a significant portion of his holdings of shares of our Class&#160;B common stock for an extended period of time, he could control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock for the foreseeable future.&#160;&#160;In addition, Mr. Stollmeyer is one of two holders of an irrevocable proxy to vote certain shares of our Class A common stock and Class&#160;B common stock held by certain of our stockholders. As a board member, Mr. Stollmeyer owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, Mr. Stollmeyer is entitled to vote his shares in his own interest, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.
