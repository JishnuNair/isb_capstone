Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us.

Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry
HEADER_3:
Our business and operations have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.
HEADER_4:
Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
HEADER_5:
Uncertain or weakened global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.
HEADER_6:
Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance.
HEADER_7:
We have a history of losses, anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability or maintain or increase cash flow on a consistent basis, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.
HEADER_8:
If we are unable to sell additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
HEADER_9:
We face intense competition in our market, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
HEADER_10:
A network or data security incident may allow unauthorized access to our network or data, harm our reputation, create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results.
HEADER_11:
Reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.
HEADER_12:
Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.
HEADER_13:
If we are unable to hire, integrate, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, our business could suffer.
HEADER_14:
If we are not successful in executing our strategy to increase sales of our products and subscriptions to new and existing medium and large enterprise end-customers, our operating results may suffer.
HEADER_15:
We rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.
HEADER_16:
Defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our products, subscriptions, or support offerings, the failure of our products or subscriptions to block a virus or prevent a security breach, misuse of our products, or risks of product liability claims could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.
HEADER_17:
False detection of applications, viruses, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data patterns, or 
HEADER_18:
 categories could adversely affect our business.
HEADER_19:
We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited, and our operating results will be harmed.
HEADER_20:
If we do not accurately predict, prepare for, and respond promptly to the rapidly evolving technological and market developments and successfully manage product and subscription introductions and transitions to meet changing end-customer needs in the enterprise security market, our competitive position and prospects will be harmed.
HEADER_21:
Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products, subscriptions, or platform features that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future, if at all.
HEADER_22:
Because we depend on manufacturing partners to build and ship our products, we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time, if at all, or on a cost-effective basis, which may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.
HEADER_23:
Managing the supply of our products and product components is complex. Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross margins.
HEADER_24:
Because some of the key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes, which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end-customers and may result in the loss of sales and end-customers.
HEADER_25:
The sales prices of our products and subscriptions may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.
HEADER_26:
We generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to distributors, resellers, and end-customers outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.
HEADER_27:
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.
HEADER_28:
A small number of channel partners represent a large percentage of our revenue and gross accounts receivable. We are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of some of our channel partners and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.

HEADER_33:
Our proprietary rights may be difficult to enforce or protect, which could enable others to copy or use aspects of our products or subscriptions without compensating us
HEADER_34:
Our use of open source software in our products and subscriptions could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and subscriptions and subject us to possible litigation.
HEADER_35:
We license technology from third parties, and our inability to maintain those licenses could harm our business.
HEADER_36:
We face risks associated with having operations and employees located in Israel.
HEADER_37:
Our failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.
HEADER_60:
We are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or this internal control may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
HEADER_61:
Our charter documents and Delaware law, as well as certain provisions of our 
HEADER_62:
, could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock.
