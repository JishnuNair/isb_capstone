Risks Related to Our Business 
HEADER_3:
The semiconductor industry may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic uncertainties which may cause our revenues and profitability to decline
HEADER_4:
We may fail to realize the benefits expected from the EZchip acquisition, which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares.
HEADER_5:
Leverage incurred in connection with the acquisition of EZchip could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent the interest rate on our variable rate debt increases and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the terms of the Term Debt.
HEADER_6:
Our Term Debt imposes certain restrictions on our business.
HEADER_7:
Servicing the debt incurred under the Term Debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.
HEADER_8:
We may pursue acquisitions of other companies or new or complementary products, technologies and businesses, which could harm our operating results, may disrupt our business and could result in unanticipated accounting charges. 
HEADER_9:
We have made and may in the future pursue investments in other companies, which could harm our operating results. 
HEADER_10:
The adoption of InfiniBand is largely dependent on third-party vendors and end users and InfiniBand may not be adopted at the rate or to the extent that we anticipate.
HEADER_11:
We have limited visibility into customer and end-user demand for our products and generally have short inventory cycles, which introduce uncertainty into our revenue and production forecasts and business planning and could negatively impact our financial results. 
HEADER_12:
We depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of any one of these customers will adversely affect our revenues. 
HEADER_13:
We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively, which could reduce our market share, net revenues and profit margin. 
HEADER_14:
Winning business is subject to lengthy, competitive selection processes that often require us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenues 
HEADER_15:
If we fail to develop new products or enhance our existing products to react to rapid technological change and market demands in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business will suffer. 
HEADER_16:
We rely on a limited number of subcontractors to manufacture, assemble, package and production test our products, and the failure of any of these third-party subcontractors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our growth. 
HEADER_17:
If we fail to carefully manage the use of "open source" software in our products, we may be required to license key portions of our products on a royalty-free basis or expose key parts of source code.

HEADER_20:
Fluctuations in our revenues and operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. 
HEADER_21:
We rely on our ecosystem partners to enhance and drive demand for our product offerings. Our inability to continue to develop or maintain such relationships in the future or our partners' inability to timely deliver technology or product offerings to the market may harm our revenues and ability to remain competitive. 
HEADER_22:
We rely primarily upon trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenues could suffer. 
HEADER_23:
We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in our products, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses.

Intellectual property litigation, which is common in our industry, could be costly, harm our reputation, limit our ability to sell our products and divert the attention of management and technical personnel. 
HEADER_25:
